"""Charlie Sheen says he is HIV-positive (CNN) Actor Charlie Sheen told NBC's """"Today"""" show Tuesday that he was diagnosed as HIV-positive about four years ago, and that a few people who knew it demanded money from him to keep the secret.  """"I'm here to admit that I am in fact HIV-positive,"""" Sheen told NBC's Matt Lauer.

Sheen, 50, said he is not sure how he contracted the virus. Since his diagnosis, he said, he has informed every sexual partner of his condition. He called it """"impossible"""" that he had transferred the virus to others.  He said the diagnosis came after he suffered a series of cluster headaches and night sweats.  """"After a battery of tests ... they walked in the room and said, 'Boom, here's what's going on,'"""" Sheen said.  """"It's a hard three letters to absorb,"""" he said.

Photos: Charlie Sheen through the years Photos: Charlie Sheen through the years Charlie Sheen has been in the public eye almost as long as the 50 years he's been alive. The actor, seen here in 2013, has appeared in dozens of films, headlined a hit TV show, battled substance abuse, dated porn stars and made numerous headlines for his bad-boy behavior. Here's a look at Sheen's turbulent life and career. Hide Caption 1 of 16 Photos: Charlie Sheen through the years As the son of actor Martin Sheen, he had small parts in some of his father's films. The public may have first become aware of him as a thuggish visitor in a police station making conversation with Jennifer Grey in 1986's """"Ferris Bueller's Day Off."""" That same year, Sheen starred in Oliver Stone's Oscar-winning film """"Platoon,"""" playing Chris, a soldier in Vietnam caught in a battle between Willem Dafoe and Tom Berenger. Hide Caption 2 of 16 Photos: Charlie Sheen through the years Sheen and Stone teamed up again in 1987 with """"Wall Street,"""" in which Sheen played an up-and-coming broker seduced by Michael Douglas' Gordon Gekko.

The box office hit led to a 1994 sequel, """"Major League II,"""" also featuring Sheen. Hide Caption 4 of 16 Photos: Charlie Sheen through the years After becoming one of the hottest young actors of the '80s, Sheen saw his star dim in the '90s. Here he is in a poster for """"Men at Work,"""" a minor comedy that starred him and brother Emilio Estevez as garbagemen who stumble on a nefarious plot. Hide Caption 5 of 16 Photos: Charlie Sheen through the years """"Terminal Velocity,"""" a 1994 film in which he played a skydiving instructor, fared even worse. Critics wondered whether the film was a goof, comparable to Sheen's """"Hot Shots!"""" parody series. It made just $17 million at the box office on a $50 million budget. Hide Caption 6 of 16 Photos: Charlie Sheen through the years By the mid-'90s, Sheen was as famous for being a ladies' man as he was for being a leading man. Known as """"the Machine,"""" he dated porn stars, and though Hollywood madam Heidi Fleiss kept the names of her clients secret, Sheen testified during her tax-evasion trial that he'd used her services. He also spent time in rehab and was hospitalized for a drug overdose . """"Pray for my boy,"""" said his father. """"He has appetites that get him into trouble.""""

The show ran until 2002. Hide Caption 8 of 16 Photos: Charlie Sheen through the years Sheen rose to the top again with """"Two and a Half Man,"""" playing free-spirited jingle writer Charlie Harper. The show was one of the highest-rated on television, and Sheen soon became the highest-paid actor on TV, eventually making close to $2 million an episode. But a rehab stint shut down production in 2010, and he and show creator Chuck Lorre were soon at loggerheads. Sheen was fired after the eighth season. Hide Caption 9 of 16 Photos: Charlie Sheen through the years Sheen occasionally popped up in movies in the 2000s, though not of the level of his '80s work. Among them were """"Scary Movie 3,"""" seen here with Denise Richards, """"Scary Movie 4"""" and """"Scary Movie 5."""" Hide Caption 10 of 16 Photos: Charlie Sheen through the years In 2002, Sheen married Richards. The marriage produced two daughters but was rocky; Richards filed a restraining order against him in 2006 and filed for divorce while pregnant with their second child. Sheen later tried to block the appearance of their children on Richards' reality show and insulted her in the media, a habit he's continued to the present day Hide Caption 11 of 16 Photos: Charlie Sheen through the years Sheen's third marriage, to actress Brooke Mueller, was also contentious. The two married in 2008 and divorced three years later, time that included Sheen's arrest on suspicion of domestic abuse and rehab stints for both. A custody battle ensued after the divorce, but the two are getting along for now. Hide Caption 12 of 16 Photos: Charlie Sheen through the years The end of Sheen's marriage to Mueller and his firing from """"Two and a Half Men"""" came in the midst of increasingly erratic behavior. He allegedly trashed a New York hotel room; he went on a radio show and criticized Lorre and Thomas Jefferson, among others; and he filed a lawsuit against Lorre and """"Two and a Half Men's"""" studio, Warner Bros. Television. He joined Twitter and racked up a million followers in just over 24 hours -- a record, said Guinness . His tweets included the hashtags #winning and #tigerblood, both of which became catchphrases. He's shown here with publicist Stan Rosenfield, who resigned from that job in early 2011. Hide Caption 13 of 16 Photos: Charlie Sheen through the years In April 2011, he embarked on tour of his one-man show, """"My Violent Torpedo of Truth/Defeat Is Not an Option."""" The first show, in Detroit, went off the rails quickly. """"Early in the evening, before the crowd turned sour, there was a creepy atmosphere that suggested group indoctrination into a cult,"""" said a Hollywood Reporter review . And that was before the booing and shouts of """"You suck"""" started. He changed the style to a Q&A for the second show, but the tour never really caught fire.

""""It's a turning point in one's life,"""" he said. Hide Caption 16 of 16  He said he revealed the diagnosis to people he thought he trusted, but some of them demanded money to keep the information to themselves. He paid those people """"in the millions,"""" he said. Later in the show, Lauer said that Sheen told him it was more than $10 million.  """"We're talking about shakedowns,"""" Sheen said. """"I've paid those people.""""  One of those people, he said, was a prostitute who entered his bathroom, took a cellphone picture of his medication and threatened to sell the image.  Asked if he would continue to pay the people he'd been paying, he said: """"Not after today, I'm not.""""  'Charlie does not have AIDS'  Sheen was joined on the show by his doctor, Robert Huizenga, an assistant professor of clinical medicine at UCLA ,and was asked directly if he had AIDS.  """"Charlie does not have AIDS,"""" Huizenga said. """"AIDS is a condition where the HIV virus markedly suppresses the immune system and you are susceptible to rare, difficult cancers and infections. Charlie has none of those. He is healthy; he does not have AIDS.""""  HIV, or human immunodeficiency virus , attacks the immune system by destroying white blood cells, which are vital to fighting infection. Once enough of these cells have been destroyed and the person has another """"opportunistic"""" infection like pneumonia or tuberculosis, the diagnosis moves to the final stage of the infection, called AIDS.  There are two main ways HIV is spread in the United States -- by sex and by sharing needles, syringes or any of the equipment used to prepare and inject drugs. Anal sex carries the highest risk, followed by vaginal sex and having multiple partners.  In the """"Today"""" interview, Sheen denied any possibility that he got the disease via drug use. """"No needles,"""" Sheen said. He also said he was no longer on drugs, but did continue to drink and seek the company of prostitutes.

Hide Caption 9 of 9  In the past, Sheen has admitted to frequent visits to prostitutes at various times in his life.

Two cases of 'unprotected sex'  Sheen told Lauer that he had unprotected sex """"under the care of my doctor"""" with two women since his diagnosis, but that it was """"impossible"""" that he had transferred the virus to them.

""""He was immediately put on treatment, strong antiviral drugs, which has suppressed the virus, to the point that he is absolutely healthy from that vantage,"""" Huizenga said. """"Individuals who are optimally treated with undetectable viral loads, (the risk is) incredibly low to transmit the virus. We can't say it's zero, but it's an incredibly low number.""""  Staying on daily medication is important to keep the HIV virus from developing resistance and spreading, experts said.

"""How Taylor Swift and Joe Alwyn's Private Romance Is Doing For those wondering how much Taylor Swift is still enjoying keeping her love life almost completely private, People has an update. Apparently t's still awesome being semi-secretly with British boyfriend of over a year, Joe Alwyn. “She seems to be in a great place both career and love wise,” a source told the outlet. Alwyn tries to attend her concert dates when he can, the source added. Footage of him there hasn't really been shared on social media, except for at the first show—a testament to how undercover these two can keep things.  Alwyn is really the best though, the source made abundantly clear: “Joe is just an amazing boyfriend. He is very supportive. Taylor adores his family. She’s in a very good place.”  Swift and Alwyn were last photographed out together on a North London pub date at the end of May. And that outing was rare itself: Swift has only been photographed out with Alwyn a couple times and has never spoken about him besides in her songs.  Last August, a source told People that this whole keeping the relationship out of the press thing really works for her. """"Her decision to keep her relationship with Joe quiet is making her happy,"""" the source said then. """"They have been getting to know each other slowly without any pressure.”  In People's new report today, its source also mentioned that Swift “has a few days off for July 4th” but gave no indication whether she'd throw the usual Taymerica party for her celeb friends at her Rhode Island estate.

"""An Analysis of Trump Supporters Has Identified 5 Key Traits Source: Gage Skidmore/Creative Commons  The lightning-fast ascent and political invincibility of has left many experts baffled and wondering, “How did we get here?” Any accurate and sufficient answer to that question must not only focus on Trump himself, but also on his uniquely loyal supporters. Given their extreme devotion and unwavering admiration for their highly unpredictable and often inflammatory , some have turned to the field of psychology for scientific explanations based on precise quantitative data and established theoretical frameworks.  Although analyses and studies by psychologists and neuroscientists have provided many thought-provoking explanations for his enduring support, the accounts of different experts often vary greatly, sometimes overlapping and other times conflicting. However insightful these critiques may be, it is apparent that more research and examination is needed to hone in on the exact psychological and social factors underlying this peculiar human behavior.  In a recent review paper published in the Journal of Social and Political Psychology, Psychologist and UC Santa Cruz professor Thomas Pettigrew argues that five major psychological phenomena can help explain this exceptional political event.  1. Authoritarian Syndrome  Authoritarianism refers to the advocacy or enforcement of strict obedience to authority at the expense of personal freedom, and is commonly associated with a lack of concern for the opinions or needs of others. Authoritarian personality syndrome—a well-studied and globally-prevalent condition—is a state of mind that is characterized by in total and complete obedience to one’s authority. Those with the syndrome often display toward outgroup members, submissiveness to authority, resistance to new experiences, and a rigid hierarchical view of society. The syndrome is often triggered by , making it easy for leaders who exaggerate threat or fear monger to gain their allegiance.  Although authoritarian personality is found among liberals, it is more common among the right-wing around the world. President Trump’s speeches, which are laced with absolutist terms like “losers” and “complete disasters,” are naturally appealing to those with the syndrome.  While research showed that Republican voters in the U.S. scored higher than Democrats on measures of authoritarianism before Trump emerged on the political scene, a 2016 Politico survey found that high authoritarians greatly favored then-candidate Trump, which led to a correct prediction that he would win the election, despite the polls saying otherwise.  2. Social dominance orientation  Social dominance orientation (SDO)—which is distinct but related to authoritarian personality syndrome—refers to people who have a preference for the societal hierarchy of groups, specifically with a structure in which the high-status groups have dominance over the low-status ones. Those with SDO are typically dominant, tough-minded, and driven by self-interest.  In Trump’s speeches, he appeals to those with SDO by repeatedly making a clear distinction between groups that have a generally higher status in society (White), and those groups that are typically thought of as belonging to a lower status (immigrants and minorities).  A 2016 survey study of 406 American adults published this year in the journal Personality and Individual Differences found that those who scored high on both SDO and authoritarianism were those who intended to vote for Trump in the election.  3.  It would be grossly unfair and inaccurate to say that every one of Trump’s supporters have prejudice against ethnic and minorities, but it would be equally inaccurate to say that many do not. It is a well-known fact that the Republican party, going at least as far back to Richard Nixon’s “southern strategy,” used strategies that appealed to bigotry, such as lacing speeches with “dog whistles”—code words that signaled prejudice toward minorities that were designed to be heard by racists but no one else.  While the dog whistles of the past were more subtle, Trump’s are sometimes shockingly direct. There’s no denying that he routinely appeals to bigoted supporters when he calls Muslims “dangerous” and Mexican immigrants “rapists” and “murderers,” often in a blanketed fashion. Perhaps unsurprisingly, a new study has shown that support for Trump is correlated with a standard scale of modern racism.  4. Intergroup contact  Intergroup contact refers to contact with members of groups that are outside one’s own, which has been experimentally shown to reduce prejudice. As such, it’s important to note that there is growing evidence that Trump’s white supporters have experienced significantly less contact with minorities than other Americans. For example, a 2016 study found that “…the racial and ethnic isolation of Whites at the zip-code level is one of the strongest predictors of Trump support.” This correlation persisted while controlling for dozens of other variables. In agreement with this finding, the same researchers found that support for Trump increased with the voters’ physical distance from the Mexican border.  5. Relative deprivation  Relative deprivation refers to the experience of being deprived of something to which one believes they are entitled. It is the discontent felt when one compares their position in life to others who they feel are equal or inferior but have unfairly had more success than them.  Common explanations for Trump’s popularity among non-bigoted voters involve economics. There is no doubt that some Trump supporters are simply angry that American jobs are being lost to Mexico and China, which is certainly understandable, although these loyalists often ignore the fact that some of these careers are actually being lost due to the accelerating pace of automation.  These Trump supporters are experiencing relative deprivation, and are common among the swing states like Ohio, Michigan, and Pennsylvania. This kind of deprivation is specifically referred to as “relative,” as opposed to “absolute,” because the feeling is often based on a skewed perception of what one is entitled to. For example, an analysis conducted by FiveThirtyEight estimated that the median annual income of Trump supporters was $72,000.  If such data is accurate, the portrayal of most Trump supporters as “working class” citizens rebelling against Republican elites may be more myth than fact.

"""All the Possible Reasons Justin Isn't Following Hailey on Instagram The Internet went wild for Justin Bieber's engagement to Hailey Baldwin—and equally as wild when people realized he doesn't even follow his fiancée back on Instagram.  The idea of a partner NOT following you back is suspect by nature: Do they not care about your life? Are they trying to hide that they're actually dating you? Did they really just forget, which honestly is more insulting than the other two?  Alas, social media isn't always a solid barometer for relationship health—and besides, when it comes to celebs, they don't exactly use Instagram the way we do. Here are three very solid explanations for why Biebz wouldn't follow the woman he's going to marry on Insta:  1. He just wants a little more privacy.  The one recent comment Justin left on Hailey's account became a news item (and he didn't even go to Pete Davidson-lengths in his PDA). If he actually followed her and commented more often, his relationship would be even more public.  """"We should empathize with the high intensity spotlight that shines on celebs,"""" says Dr. Suzanne Degges-White, chair and professor of counseling and counselor education at Northern Illinois University. """"If most of us felt that every tweet or public appearance we made was going to be picked apart by strangers, we might want to lay low, too!""""    Hailey also had mentioned that the last time they dated, she felt like it was too much of a high-profile relationship. This also was, coincidentally, when they both posted a lot more of themselves as a couple on social media.  2. He's been afraid to jinx his relationship with Hailey, which is still new.  Let's face it: Justin and Hailey's engagement is shocking, because they haven't really been dating for that long (and weren't in a long-term relationship the last time, either). Justin only posted the one photo only after his proposal was all over the news, which may mean that he's reluctant to go too hard on the Insta PDA right now. The lack of a follow-back could just be a habit of, """"We just started dating, and I don't want to over-commit on social media.""""  """"As for the fear of 'jinxing' a relationship, that might be reflected in [his] hesitation to intermingle [their lives], including [in] social media posts,"""" Dr. Degges-White says. """"It’s always a pain to have to cope with trying to edit or delete past public posts."""" Especially if, you know, you're a celebrity whose photos and captions would be screenshotted within seconds.    3. He actually feels confident about the relationship.  The irony is that Justin Bieber being nonchalant about following his partner on social media might demonstrate that he's actually feeling pretty good about where he stands with Hailey.  """"Research actually tells us that couples who frequently post pictures together use it perhaps as a mechanism to mask their insecurities in the relationship, depending on their attachment style,"""" says Dr. Mariana Bockarova, Ph.D., who teaches the course """"Psychology of Relationships"""" at the University of Toronto.  """"If you were an anxiously attached person, who often feels worried about your partner leaving you, you might increase your relationship visibility and be more likely to post photos together to solidify your relationship together in the public sphere.""""  Justin may forego hitting that """"follow"""" button for one simple reason: He feels secure in his attachment to Hailey and doesn't need to keep tabs on her, or prove to anyone else that he's keeping tabs on her. Romantic vacations will do just fine.  4. He's Justin Bieber. Does he look like he cares?  This is the theory ~I~ personally believe the most. I mean, this is a man who strolls the streets of NYC in hotel slippers. He also recently skipped out on a bunch of award shows—regardless of how many times he was nominated—so he could keep working on his album.  All to say, Justin Bieber has spent a long chunk of his life in the spotlight. And, if his recent behavior indicates anything, it's that he's starting to care a bit less about what people think of him, especially on social media. So what if he doesn't follow Hailey? He's not thinking about whether you care. Maybe he especially won't follow her back now just to assert his independence over what everyone expects him to do.  """"Without knowing Justin or Hailey, it may just be a matter of social media not being important to their personal lives,"""" Dr. Bockarova says. She also adds that caring a lot about how your partner interacts with you on social media, whether they like all your photos or post enough selfies with you, might be a problem. """"If you are feeling the need to compare yourself to others, which might include comparing your partner with others, there's much more at stake than just a healthy relationship.""""  """"The 'virtual world' is still just virtual—we can attribute all sorts of nefarious motivations or perceived signs into others’ behavior,"""" Dr. Degges-White says. """"But when it comes down to it, what really matters is how two people treat each other when no one is watching.""""  Is Justin Bieber a good partner to Hailey? Time will tell, and the only person who knows that is her—not anyone checking his profile to see if he's following her back yet.

"""Justin Theroux 'was with girlfriend Heidi Bivens when he fell for Jennifer Aniston' 'Justin was very much with girlfriend Heidi when he fell for HER,' confirms friend of Jennifer Aniston's beau Theroux    By DAILY MAIL REPORTER    After a whirlwind romance and various displays of public affection, Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux appear very much in love.  But their blooming relationship may not be all that it appears to be, with friends of the stars believing that Jen, 42, might have jumped in too quickly.    'Justin will never marry her,' a close friend told InTouch Weekly Magazine.    Inseparable: Yet the pair appear very much in love and have spent the past three months travelling together for work and pleasure  'He's not the marrying type - as you can see from the 14-year relationship he was in that didn't end in marriage.'  In love: Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux might be moving too fast according to friends  But it isn't just their career paths and ambitions that differ - they work in completely different social circles as well.  'He is not the kind of guy to be owned.'    But more worryingly, it seems as if the idea that Justin, 40, was still very much involved with his former girlfriend when he met Jen, could have more truth to it than initially thought.    'He totally lied to Heidi and broke her heart,' a source told the magazine of Justin's ex Heidi Bivens, claiming that when he 'met and fell in love' with Jen he was still 'very taken.'  With insiders claiming that the relationship may not last, the differences between the clean-cut actress and the bad-boy screenplay writer have already begun to show.  'Jen is the complete opposite of Justin,' said a friend.    'She's all about Malibu and shopping and trying to stay young while Justin is about being an artist.'  The other woman: Justin was in a 14-year relationship with Heidi Bivens when he met Jennifer on the set of Wanderlust Justin even turned down the chance to star in Friends, the show which made Jen a millionaire and a household name, claiming that he would 'hang himself' if he got tied into a seven year TV contract. 'The last place Jen would want to go in New York would be a dive bar,' said the friend claiming that Justin, however, is a regular fixture in certain dive bars in the city.  Jen meanwhile is known for her love of a swanky wine bar, and is regularly seen at LA's plush Tower Bar in The Sunset Towers Hotel. But despite the obvious differences, Jen and Justin have been inseparable in recent months with rumours swirling of a possible pregnancy and wedding.  'This is the guy she wants to grow old with,' said the friend. 'She is head over heels in love with him.'

"""Revealing Details About Prince William and Prince Harry’s Royal Feud With Camilla Royal feuds are as old as the throne itself.  Prince William and Prince Harry have known of their stepmother, Camilla, since very early in their lives. The high-profile and public affair between Camilla and Prince Charles is something the boys will never truly forget. Understandably, they have had a rocky relationship with Camilla over the years. Some years have been better than others, but it’s impossible to completely erase the dark history between each other.  Let’s take a quick look at the revealing details behind the relationship between Prince William, Prince Harry, and Camilla, including a major sign of progress for their relationship (No. 9). We’ll also discuss the surprisingly blunt statement from Prince William (No. 12).  1. William was resistant to meeting Camilla  In the summer of 1997, two months before Diana’s death, Charles sat his kids down to talk to them about Camilla. He explained their relationship from his point of view, but Diana had already tainted the mere thought of Camilla for the boys. William was especially resistant to meeting her. Charles did not push the relationship on the boys because he wanted them to warm up to her and knew they were aware of the trouble Camilla had caused Charles and Diana.  Next: William took the initiative.  2. William eventually set up a meeting with Camilla to clear the air  After taking a break from pushing the boys to meet Camilla, Charles tried once more. In 1998, William finally agreed to set up a meeting with Camilla so he could learn a little more about her. Afterward, both agreed that things went well. However, Camilla was not yet out of the woods with William. There was still a lot he wanted to know.  Next: The brothers did not meet her at the same time.  3. Harry let William get to know her first  Harry did not attend the meet up with William. Instead, he met Camilla a few weeks later over tea. The two were at Highgrove, Charles’ home. Camilla’s children were present as well, and it was reportedly more casual than her meeting with William. Tensions were not as high, possibly since William had gotten to know Camilla a bit and filled Harry in.  Next: Diana made no bones about her feelings.  4. Diana made her feelings about Camilla clear to her sons  It was evident that Diana was not OK with the affair between Charles and Camilla. She quickly confronted Camilla about it and reportedly let her sons know, too. She referred to him as “Charles’ lady” to her sons. The boys immediately got a bad taste in their mouths about Camilla, which likely led to a years-long, up-and-down relationship with their father’s current wife.  Next: Things did not improve too quickly.  5. The relationship was still rocky at Charles’ 50th birthday party  The boys organized a birthday party for Charles when he was turning 50. They made the nice gesture of inviting Camilla to sit with Charles. However, it’s been reported that their relationship was still very tentative at the time. The boys wanted to make progress with Camilla but still felt shadowed by how she had split up their mother and father.  Next: This person may have had an influence on the boys, too.  6. The queen may have delayed the brothers’ acceptance of Camilla  At Charles’ party, Camilla sat with him, and the whole family celebrated his milestone birthday. The one missing person? The queen. She refused to attend the event knowing Camilla would be present. The queen had still not accepted her son’s infidelity. Her hesitation toward letting Camilla join the family may have fueled additional hesitation from William and Harry.  Next: Charles took a big step with this invitation.  7. A family vacation built some connection  William, Harry, and Charles were set to fly to Greece to spend a vacation together. Charles invited Camilla to attend. She accepted the invitation and flew to Greece with the family. While it is unclear exactly what happened there, it appeared that the boys enjoyed the time spent with their father and Camilla.  Next: Things were looking up for Camilla and the boys.  8. By the time Camilla and Charles married, her relationship with the boys had greatly improved  Camilla wed Charles in 2005. After the wedding, Harry had nothing but good things to say about his new stepmother. “[Camilla is] a wonderful woman who makes my father very, very happy,” Harry said in an interview with BBC. “William and I love her to bits.” He also reinforced that they do not see her as a wicked stepmother.  Next: William played a big role in his father’s second wedding.  9. William served as his father’s ‘best man’  While William had fewer comments about Camilla than Harry, his brother did say that both of them loved Camilla very much. Although “best man” is not a traditional wedding position in England — groomsmen are typically called “supporters” — William served as Charles’ best man equivalent in the wedding. When Charles asked, William accepted without much hesitation.  Next: This gift from Camilla symbolized a harmonious family.  10. Camilla gave Kate Middleton a gift at William and Kate’s wedding  When William and Kate tied the knot in 2011, Camilla gave Kate a special wedding gift. It was a gold charm bracelet with each of their initials engraved on either side. Kate sported the bracelet on multiple occasions, as if to say that she was happy to have Camilla in the family. It seemed as though the feud between Charles’ children and Camilla had finally ended.  Next: … but things have not been perfect since.  11. The brothers were silent at Camilla’s 70th birthday celebration  The Daily Mail recently reported that at Camilla’s 70th birthday celebration, no words were said by the brothers. Most people expected the brothers to make a public statement about their stepmother, whom they had once seemed to fully patch things up with. Instead, they stayed silent, leading people to question whether things had changed between the three.  Next: This statement from William hints at an unstable relationship.  12. William made it clear that his children only have two grandmothers  2017 marked 20 years since the tragic death of William’s mother, Princess Diana. In Diana, Our Mother: Her Life and Legacy, William made it clear that Camilla was not a grandmother to his two children. “… [I] just try and remind them that there are two grandmothers — there were two grandmothers — in their lives,” he said. William did not mention Camilla when speaking about the childrens’ grandmothers, even though she was their grandfather’s wife and had known them since birth, just like Kate’s mother.  Next: It appears the tides have turned.  13. More than a decade later, the relationship ‘has changed’  A source later confirmed to the Daily Mail that things have not been the same between Camilla and the boys in recent years. “They are not close to Camilla anymore,” said a friend of the royal family. “The relationship has changed.” Other friends of the family have backed up those claims. One person, an old friend of Diana’s, said, “It was pretty clear they don’t have a good word for Camilla.”  Next: The boys don’t want Camilla gaining this role.  14. They likely do not want Camilla to be named queen  The public has made it clear that when Charles is passed the throne and becomes king, Camilla should not be queen. That was supposed to be Diana’s role, and the public remains loyal to her. They have also declined to call Camilla “Princess of Wales” because that was Diana’s title. Since the boys have seemed to distance themselves from Camilla, it’s likely that they do not want her to be queen, either. Rumors have swirled that the feud has heated up again since it was suggested that William and Kate take the role, but those rumors have not been confirmed.  Next: This one thing could be a big reason for their resistance.  15. The boys never fully came to terms with their mother’s death  In Diana, Our Mother, Harry and William went into detail about how little they actually cried over their mother. Harry made a comment that he still felt like there was much more he had to let out about her death. Since the boys seemed to never properly mourn their mother, they may have never had that closure that would allow them to let another mother into their lives. Plus, Camilla caused Diana so much pain that not having the closure of her death might make it even more difficult to let someone like that in.  Next: Is there already a feud between Camilla and Meghan Markle?  16. For starters: Why would they fight?  Meghan and Camilla can’t possibly know each other very well. And Camilla recently gushed over the engagement to Prince Harry. So why would a feud be on the horizon? As one online rag alleges, the Duchess of Cornwall has never thought the American actress was worthy of marrying into the royal family.  Next: Trying to decipher how a feud might have started.  17. Why would Camilla think of Meghan this way?  For starters, Camilla supposedly isn’t fond of Meghan because she is American and does not come from a royal background. (Camilla allegedly felt the same way about Kate Middleton entering the royal family, so there could potentially be some truth to this rumor.) It is also rumored that Camilla wasn’t a fan of Meghan dumping her boyfriend of two years the second she met Harry, seeing it as a social climbing move. (Something Meghan’s stepsister has also accused her of.)  Next: Seeing if a fight interrupted the engagement timeline.  18. Was the engagement really postponed?  According to Inquisitr, Camilla flew to Toronto in the summer of 2017 to tell Meghan in person that she should not accept a marriage proposal from Harry. And that, if Meghan accepted, the Camilla would “make life difficult” for her. While Harry and Meghan announced their engagement later in the year, it was alleged that Camilla’s meddling pushed things back.  Next: Examining the lengths Camilla might have gone to.  19. Has Camilla continued to cause trouble?  New Idea claims that Camilla didn’t stop at trying to sabotage the engagement. The site alleges that the duchess is responsible for at least 14 key staffers at Buckingham Palace resigning, which in turn postponed the early stages of planning the wedding. It’s also said that Prince Harry was livid and supposedly confronted his stepmother about the matter. (Of course, this is all from “well-placed sources” and it isn’t completely clear if this rumor is true.)  Next: Relating the allegations to previous rumors.  20. Has Camilla meddled like this before?  As it turns out, this isn’t the first time that Camilla has been accused of trying to ruin a royal wedding. Gossip columns pointed their fingers at her back in 2011 for allegedly trying to interfere with Prince William and Kate Middleton’s relationship. It was said that Camilla had confidantes leak lies about Kate to the tabloids in order to paint her in a bad light.  Next: Speaking of Duchess Catherine …  21. What does Kate think?  Here’s where things get interesting. One gossip rag claims that the Duchess of Cambridge and the future royal have joined forces to kick Camilla out of the royal family. Another gossip site, Gossip Cop, says that story is untrue because it has “inside sources” telling it the claim is 100% not true. (Although if you read the bottom of that post, it appears this could just be a case of two tabloids fighting with each other.)  Next: Only one questions remains …  22. Will we ever know the truth?  Unless Meghan unleashes a right hook that connects with Camilla’s jaw, we’ll likely never know if the two are actually at odds or not. Surely there will be a million photographers trying to catch Camilla glaring in Meghan’s direction at the wedding. Or body language experts deciphering how uncomfortable they look standing next to each other. But for now, all we have is the good ol’ rumor mill.  Additional reporting by Chelena Goldman.

"""Kate Middleton Had a Massive Fortune Before She Was a Duchess. Here’s What We Know About the Royal’s Net Worth Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge wasn’t always a royal, but even before her marriage to Prince William, Kate Middleton had an impressive net worth.  Middleton had a comfortable upbringing before she became the first commoner to join the royal family after she married William in 2011. But Middleton’s net worth ballooned once she became a duchess.  Daily Money Sign up to receive the latest updates and the smartest advice. View Sample Sign Up Now  Here’s everything we know about Middleton’s net worth:  What is Kate Middleton’s net worth?  The 36 year-old mother of three — who gave birth to a second baby boy in April — is worth at least £5 million, or $7 million, according to global wealth-tracking firm Wealth-X, though some estimates put her net worth as high as £7.3 million, or $10 million. Middleton’s wealth is mostly in cash because she doesn’t have a personal portfolio of property or artwork.  That being said, Middleton’s net worth is a lot less than her prince — Wealth-X estimates Prince William’s net worth is at least $30 million, though some reports put his fortune closer to $40 million. According to Wealth-X, $19 million of Prince William’s wealth is in cash. The wealth tracking firm also noted that William has an expensive helicopter fit for a royal — an Augusta A109S Grand helicopter which is valued at $11 million.  Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, Princess Charlotte of Cambridge, Prince George of Cambridge and Prince William, Duke of Cambridge arrive for a children's party for Military families during the Royal Tour of Canada on September 29, 2016 in Victoria, Canada. Chris Jackson—Getty Images  What do we know about Kate Middleton’s money?  Most of Middleton’s net worth stems from Party Pieces, an online party supplies business started by her parents. The company is estimated to be worth around £30 million, or $50 million, thanks in no small part to the exposure it gets from being associated with the royals, according to royal expert Marlene Koenig.  Prior to her life as a full-time duchess, Middleton worked for the family business and was a part-time accessories buyer for a retailer called Jigsaw.  Growing up, Kate and her two siblings, Pippa and James Middleton, attended expensive privates schools from a young age, with years of tuition for just one child estimated to be at least £250,000, or $350,000. Kate met Prince William while in college in Scotland at the prestigious University of St. Andrew’s. She graduated in 2005 with a degree in Art History.  How did Kate Middleton’s net worth change after marrying Prince William?  Joining the royal family meant that Middleton was marrying into an incredible $88 billion fortune amassed over generations.  Before Will and Kate became the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and moved into a 20-room apartment in Kensington Palace, Kate lived in an apartment purchased by her parents in the Chelsea neighborhood of London believed to be worth £1 million, or $1.4 million.  Prince William, Duke of Cambridge and Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge smile following their marriage at Westminster Abbey on April 29, 2011 in London, England. Chris Jackson—Getty Images  But once Kate officially became a royal she didn’t need to spend much of her own money anymore. Most of her living costs are covered by the private estate Prince Charles manages, the Duchy of Cornwall. The revenue from the Duchy of Cornwall pays for the most of Prince Charles and his family’s royal expenses: things like official travel, wardrobe, housing and staff costs. When Meghan Markle marries Prince Harry on May 19, she too, will get to keep most of her own money — her net worth is believed to be about $5 million — as the Duchy of Cornwall will also absorb the majority of her living costs associated with royal responsibilities.  What is the ‘Kate effect’?  As the Duchess of Cambridge, Kate sets fashion trends all over the world. While she herself does not retain any income from the flurry of economic activity set off by the designer clothes she wears for public appearances, she has triggered what is known as “the Kate Effect,” meaning that whatever she wears more or less sells out immediately across the globe. Some designer labels she has worn have had to double their staff just to keep up with demand after a photo of her in a particular outfit is published.  LONDON, ENGLAND - JUNE 17: Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, Princess Charlotte of Cambridge, Prince George of Cambridge and Prince William, Duke of Cambridge look out from the balcony of Buckingham Palace during the Trooping the Colour parade on June 17, 2017 in London, England. Chris Jackson—Getty Images  Her two older children, Prince George, 4, who is third in line for the throne, and Princess Charlotte, 2, also produce the “Prince George Effect” and the “Princess Charlotte Effect.” According to Brand Finance, Princess Charlotte could spur as much as $5 billion boost to the economy, with Prince George creating a slightly smaller economic impact, estimated to be around $3.6 billion. Their third royal baby could generate up to $1 billion for the British economy.  Correction: This article originally misstated Prince William dukedom.

The dashing, ginger-haired royal has jetted around the globe for years to represent his family at charitable events. He’s been admired by many for his convictions to worthy causes. It was only a matter of time for the prince to meet his match in Meghan Markle, another successful socialite devoted to philanthropy.  While each half of the couple is financially set in their own right, Prince Harry is said to be worth $40 million – which is only a fraction of his family’s worth, including palaces, jewels, and artwork. Once they have tied the knot, however, the prince is unlikely to share his royal fortune with his American bride for one surprising reason. It has to do with her nationality. Here we’ll take a look at the factors involved.  Markle will become a British citizen  The citizenship process takes 3 years.  When the couple’s engagement was announced in December 2017, it was revealed Markle would become a British citizen. This process will likely take about three years. “She intends to become a U.K. citizen and will go through the process of that, which some of you know takes a number of years,” said Prince Harry’s communications secretary, Jason Knauf. “She will retain her U.S. citizenship through that process.”  It has not yet been revealed whether Markle will ultimately give up her American citizenship or maintain a dual nationality status.  Next: The U.S. taxes its citizens living abroad.  The U.S. taxes Markle’s income  Some of her $50,000-per-episode salary goes to Uncle Sam.  While she remains a U.S. citizen, Markle’s income will continue to be taxed by Uncle Sam. Much of this income currently comes from her USA Network show Suits. It was revealed in November 2017 Markle would leave the popular legal drama at the end of Season 7. (The second half of that season is set to air in 2018.) Markle reportedly earns more than $50,000 per episode of Suits. Her estimated yearly income is $450,000, which also includes around $80,000 in endorsement money, according to knownetworth.com.  Next: Prince Harry inherited millions.  Prince Harry inherited half his mom’s millions  The two princes inherited $29.2 million from Princess Diana.  When Princess Diana died in 1997, Prince Harry inherited half of her estate, which was worth about $29.2 million. He also shares a $4.7 million annual allowance with his brother and sister-in-law, Prince William and Kate Middleton. Taking that into account along with the rest of the royal family’s worth, Markle is about to marry into a fortune.  Next: How the U.S. could get richer off the marriage  Uncle Sam would tax Markle’s royal money  The U.S. would want a piece of the royal pie.  If Markle receives any money from the royal family, she may need to pay U.S. income taxes on it. “If she receives money from her husband or his family, and that’s considered income, she would have to pay income tax on that,” royal expert Marlene Koenig told The Sun.  Interestingly, if the couple were to marry and then live in the United States, Prince Harry wouldn’t be expected to file taxes in Britain. The U.S. system of taxing its citizens abroad is unusual. It originated during the Civil War to punish men who fled the country to avoid fighting in the war.  Next: Well-kept secrets could be revealed.  Royal family secrets would be revealed  Information on royal finances could go public.  Other than the royal pain of owing British money to the United States, Prince Harry and his family could take another hit. If Markle reports income from the royal family to the IRS, she would have to divulge details about the royal family’s estate on her tax forms. The family’s finances have long been “impenetrable” to others, according to David McClure, author of Royal Legacy: How the Royal Family Have Made, Spent and Passed on Their Wealth.  “You can be sure that those at Buckingham Palace and those who run the accounts are looking very carefully at all of this to make sure that the royal family’s money does not get reported to the IRS!” royal expert Koenig said.  Next: The royal family’s net worth  How much the royal family is worth  Royal family net worth: $88 billion  Since the royal family has kept its money details under lock and key, it’s impossible to estimate the family’s net worth with 100% certainty. However, the most recent royal family net worth estimate was to the tune of a whopping $88 billion. Around $33 billion of that is made up from Buckingham Palace, the royal art collection, crown jewels, and the Duchies of Lancaster and Cornwall.  As accurate as that number may be, it’s still speculation, and the Royals will surely want to continue to guard their wealth secrets closely.  Next: Meghan Markle’s personal net worth  How much Meghan Markle is worth  Meghan Markle’s net worth: $7 million  If Prince Harry chooses to avoid the tax hassle by not sharing any royal family money with Markle for three years, she would likely get by just fine. Markle’s personal net worth is reported as $7 million by knownetworth.com. Other than her income from Suits and endorsements, she has also brought in almost $400,000 from three movies in which she appeared. She also worked as a freelance calligrapher for income during her early acting days.  Next: A massive boost for the economy  A $680 million royal boost  The wedding could boost the UK economy by $680 million.  Markle joining the royal family won’t mean all financial headaches. The couple’s May 19 wedding will reportedly boost the U.K. economy $680 million, according to Reuters. The report attributed $500 million of that to tourism, travel, and hotels. In addition, $67 million is predicted from the sale of commemorative items like T-shirts and hats. Commoners celebrating the royal wedding are expected to spend more than $200 million throwing parties.

"""Why do people dislike Hillary Clinton? The story goes far back A sense of untrustworthiness has haunted the Democrat this election, but the roots of hostility against her are much deeper  There is – and perhaps there always will be – a dedicated group of people who don’t know Hillary Clinton personally, but nonetheless hate her.  Whether they are truly a “vast rightwing conspiracy” (as Clinton called them in 1998) or just many in number and conservative in outlook, there’s no arguing that they exist or that they continue to try to influence public opinion on the Democratic nominee.    But even if people consider themselves savvy enough to reject the strangest conspiracy theories (sample claims include that she is a mass-murderer, a closeted lesbian faking her 40-year marriage, a member of the Illuminati and/or an agent of the devil himself), there seems little doubt that an undercurrent of hostility spanning decades has had an impact upon how she is viewed.  Clinton’s unfavorability rating may not be as low as Donald Trump’s, but in an election year which has frequently degenerated into name-calling, she has attracted invective from both the left and the right. Polls have frequently cited the public view that she is not trusted, while Trump has rallied his supporters with the “Crooked Hillary” epithet.  Her links to Wall Street, her missing emails and her supposed responsibility for the security failures that contributed to the attack on the Benghazi consulate are the ostensible reasons for some deeply personal attacks in 2016. But the roots of hostility towards her go much deeper.  Craig Shirley, a Ronald Reagan biographer and historian who spent decades as a conservative political consultant, said that, when Hillary Clinton arrived in Washington DC as first lady, “she came from Little Rock with a reputation already established” as “such a militant feminist, difficult to deal with”.  He noted that she faced hostility in Arkansas politics and media when Bill Clinton was first elected governor, because she kept her maiden name.“Here she comes, the feminist from Wellesley and Yale,” Shirley explained of the supposedly prevailing attitude of the time, “down to Little Rock and brings her attitudes with her”.  There’s something about her manner, persona, voice, smirk that just grates on a lot of people Craig Shirley, conservative political consultant  So by the time she arrived on the national stage in 1991, during Bill Clinton’s presidential campaign, the then-still-mostly-male press corps already had an idea of who they understood Hillary Clinton to be – a potential liability to her husband’s political career whose feminism and ambition were a bit unseemly.    And, as she noted in her first autobiography, she gave them plenty of material with which to support that narrative. First, there was her much-maligned “I’m not sitting here some little woman standing by my man like Tammy Wynette” comment in response to a reporter’s assertion that she and her husband had “some sort of understanding and arrangement” about his infidelity.  Then, her out-of-context “I suppose I could have stayed home and baked cookies” comment, which came in response to attacks, which the Clintons denied, by now-California governor Jerry Brown that she had only been a successful lawyer because her husband had steered business to her firm, implying that she should have confined herself to being a ceremonial first lady.  And then, of course, came the scandals in which she was involved: Whitewater, a money-losing land deal in which she’d invested for their retirement with two friends who managed the investment illegally; and Travelgate, in which she – contrary to the then-normal practice of leaving the business of the White House to the president’s staff – was said to have ordered the firing of the head of the travel office, who coincidentally was popular with the mostly-male White House press corps whose travel he arranged.  Facebook Twitter Pinterest President Bill Clinton takes his oath of office, accompanied by Hillary Rodham Clinton, in 1993. Photograph: Everett/Rex/Shutterstock  The key question raised about Whitewater and Travelgate was not whether Clinton had done anything actually wrong, but whether she had used illegal means to try to keep the media from finding out. The Starr investigation, which eventually resulted in Bill Clinton’s impeachment, found that she had not, but by that time her reputation was established as someone unfriendly to the media who also maybe did not do the right thing.  This business of people ‘not liking’ her is shaped ... by what we think people in authority ought to look like Elaine Kamarck, Brookings Institution fellow  Shirley conceded that “the press pounded on her” first in Arkansas and then in Washington, but did not believe that affected her relationship with the media, or that it was a driving factor in people’s attitudes towards her. “There’s something about her manner, persona, voice, smirk that just grates on a lot of people,” he said. “People don’t like to be talked down to, and she has a terrible habit of talking down to people, with that smirk.”  However, Elaine Kamarck, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who served in Bill Clinton’s administration, said she did not think that people’s dislike of Hillary Clinton is her own fault. “This business of people ‘not liking’ her is shaped by expectations, by television, by what we think people in authority ought to look like, and not who she actually is,” she said.    “She is absolutely as likable, or more likable, than many male politicians,” she said. But while it is rare that people will compare a male politician they do not like to their fathers Kamarck noted that Clinton “reminds people of their mothers, or the schoolteacher they didn’t like.” (References to a “nagging wife” and “bitchy wife” are also common.)  “I think there’s some misogyny in that,” said Kamarck, noting that it’s exceedingly common for men who don’t hew to conventional standards of attractiveness to be on television or pursue political careers, while women are more likely to be granted that visibility when they are younger and if they meet traditional beauty standards.  “We will overcome this but, right now, the world is accustomed to saying old men are fine, they’re strong, they’re wise,” she added. “Old women, we’re not so sure.”""",/home/yanwang_nuist/dev_workspace/prj_python/fnd-bootstrap/dataset/gossip/Images/gossip_test/sL8CIBG67qHO6vz7yecmPcGRKEqkW8X3.jpg,0.0
"""Jennifer Aniston 'stopped visiting Justin Theroux's home' On Thursday, it was announced that she had parted ways with Justin Theroux, after just two-and-a-half years of marriage.  And it has now been reported that Jennifer Aniston, 49, had stopped regularly spending time with the actor and writer several months before they made their shocking announcement.  According to TMZ, the former Friends star was last seen at her estranged husband's apartment in New York City's Greenwich Village in October, with sources telling the website that she'd stopped regular visits as far back as August.  Separated: Jennifer Aniston reportedly stopped regularly spending time with Justin Theroux several months ago, and was last photographed by TMZ at his New York City home in October  A further report from ETOnline suggests the couple split over a disagreement about where they should live.  Sources close to the pair have claimed that a difference of opinion on where to live was one of the main causes for the break up, with Jennifer preferring Los Angeles, while Justin opting for New York.  An insider explained to ETOnline: 'He much prefers being [in New York] and that's been a major issue for them for a long time.  'Justin has a very diverse friend group, and he likes that they're not all 'in the industry. He's friends with people in the restaurant world, writers, comedians, artists, tattoo artists. It's an eclectic group and he doesn't have that type of network in LA.  'Justin can hop on his [motorcycle], walk in the neighborhood, hang at a bar and all that without being bothered, but for Jen, the paparazzi are all over her.  Separation: The estranged couple reportedly signed an 'iron-clad' pre-nup before their August 2015 wedding, reports US Weekly  'He really wanted her to be comfortable [in New York. He even negotiated with the paps to make a deal that they would only shoot her once per day and then leave her alone. He also agreed to move out of his apartment, which he loves.'  'She just never really could get settled in, she wasn't happy [in New York. He was bicoastal, she was not.'  According to The Sun, the paparazzi is another reason for the split, after they took up residency in a park opposite their home, which infuriated the neighbours.  It's said that because of this, said neighbours covered Justin's beloved motorcycle with bits of Bologna sausage one day in an act of protest.  Split: A source told the website: 'Jennifer has an ironclad prenup with Justin. It would be very hard for Justin to contest it. The prenup talks before the marriage were long and intense'  Justin apparently blamed Jennifer for this, as the paparazzi were pestering the couple more so for pictures of her, rather than him.  The source added that the pair fought to make their relationship work but were ultimately unsuccessful.  The insider explained: 'They really were a great couple. And they cared a lot about each other. Justin was always really protective of her. They both wanted this to work.'  While the exes have yet to file for divorce, it has also been claimed they had taken a crucial step to protect their multi-million dollar fortunes, with an 'iron-clad' pre-nup signed before their August 2015 wedding, reports US Weekly.  A source told the publication: 'Jennifer has an ironclad prenup with Justin. It would be very hard for Justin to contest it. The prenup talks before the marriage were long and intense. Jen’s assets and Friends fortune are protected.'  Acclaimed: Jennifer, 49, who is most famous for her portrayal of Rachel Green on iconic sitcom Friends, is worth an estimated $200m (above with L-R co-stars Lisa Kudrow, Matt Le Blanc, David Schwimmer, Matthew Perry and Courtney Cox)  Jennifer, who is most famous for her portrayal of Rachel Green on iconic sitcom Friends, is worth an estimated $200 million.  For the last two seasons of Friends, which ran between 1994 and 2004, Jennifer and her five co-stars were paid a record $1 million an episode.  She has also starred in a string of hit films including Horrible Bosses, Bruce Almighty, and He's Just Not That Into You, amassed an impressive property portfolio and is the face of campaigns included SmartWater.  Justin, who has starred in TV shows The Leftovers, Parks and Recreation and Sex and The City, as well as worked as a screenwriter on films including Tropic Thunder, and Zoolander 2, is worth an estimated $20 million.  Talented: She has also starred in a string of hit films including Horrible Bosses (above), Bruce Almighty, and He's Just Not That Into You  MailOnline has contacted representatives for Jennifer and Justin for comment.  The decision to go their separate ways 'was mutual and lovingly made at the end of last year', according to a statement released on Thursday through Jennifer's publicist.  The Along Came Polly star became engaged to the Leftovers actor in August 2012, and they married in a surprise ceremony at their LA home on August 5, 2015.  The couple's statement says they would have handled their separation privately, but they wanted to counter tabloid speculation and 'convey the truth directly.'  They say they intend to maintain love and respect for each other.  Jennifer and Justin were last pictured together during a New Year's getaway trip to Cabo San Lucas, Mexico.  Multi-millions: Justin, 46, who has starred in TV shows including The Leftovers (above), Parks and Recreation and Sex and The City, as well as worked as a screenwriter on films including Tropic Thunder, and Zoolander 2, is worth an estimated $20m.  The shock split will come as a surprise to many as Justin had previously described Jennifer as his 'ally'.  He shared with United Airlines' Rhapsody magazine back in April 2017: 'Marriage makes the small things much smaller and the big things small. You have an ally. It's good to have someone have your back.'The couple tied the knot in August 2015 and it was made 'so much more special' because they kept it secret.  Justin added: 'It's so much more special when it's just your closest friends and family and it's lovely. [Jennifer and I] wanted it to be a peaceful environment, you don't want it to be hectic.'  Justin had admitted being married to Jennifer has had a calming effect on him.  He explained: 'Obviously, I'm married. I think marriage taught me to settle a little bit. It does have a calming effect. I think it's at what age you make that commitment. When you hear about people in the '50s getting married at 20, you're like, What were they thinking?  Spark: The two reconnected and ultimately began dating when working together in 2012's Wanderlust, five years after meeting on the set of Tropic Thunder  'My grandparents were together for over 50 years. My grandfather used to write one sentence every day in his journal: """"I love Anne more than ever today."""" I think that was his meditation - keeping him in his marriage, and also his appreciation for it. It was very touching.'  Jennifer and Justin met on set of Ben Stiller and Jack Black comedy Tropic Thunder in 2007.  The two reconnected and ultimately began dating when working together in 2012's Wanderlust.  They got engaged on his 41st birthday while dining at Dan Barber restaurant Blue Hill in Greenwich Village, New York City in August 2012.  Three years later Jennifer and Justin married in a top secret ceremony at their home in Los Angeles in August 2016.  Jennifer was previously married to Brad Pitt from 2000 to 2005.""",/home/yanwang_nuist/dev_workspace/prj_python/fnd-bootstrap/dataset/gossip/Images/gossip_test/LfBoKIA4B3jQ22EKWCpghIvGipgb5IXQ.jpg,0.0
"""Kim Kardashian Revealed How Much Saint’s Diaper Bag Costs, & It’s, Um, Shocking The diaper bag I use for my toddler ran about $70. To me, that was a pretty hefty price to pay. Then Kim Kardashian revealed how much Saint's diaper bag costs. I don't think I could complain about dropping $70 on anything in my life again. Kardashian's diaper bag for Saint reportedly costs $23,000, Us Weekly reported, citing a blog post the celebrity mom wrote Thursday.  The diaper bag in question is a Hermès Birkin purse, which usually cost thousands of dollars, according to ABC. (The most expensive Birkin handbag sold for $379,261 in June.) So it shouldn't be a surprise that Kardashian is carrying around a $23,000 diaper bag for her 20-month-old son. I won't lie, though: I choked on my water when I saw that price tag.  In a post for her official app, Kardashian explained more about the origin of Saint's diaper bag,  But the thing is, it’s a really old bag. It was my first Birkin bag that I ever bought. ... But that’s all they had and I just wanted one so badly and I’d saved and saved and that’s all they had and I took it. When I got pregnant I was like, ‘perfect! I’ll use it as a diaper bag.’  This isn't the first time Kardashian used a diaper bag with a price tag in the five-digit range. According to the Hollywood Life, the 36-year-old entrepreneur used a $30,000 Hermès Birkin handbag to carry around diapers, snacks, and wipes when daughter North West was only a few months old in 2013.  Still, for many of us, $23,000 is a shocking price. After all, that's how much I spend on nearly two year's worth of rent. It's a huge chunk of change most of us won't have the chance to hold in our hands for even a second. Of course, I'm not judging Kardashian for dropping that kind of money; she has it to spend, obviously, and spend she should. And it seems her Hermès Birkin bag will stand the test of time and weather, which is more than I could say for mine.  In fact, as US Weekly pointed out, Kardashian could probably use the Hermès Birkin diaper bag when she and Kayne West have their third child next year via surrogacy. (Kardashian has been quite public about her high-risk pregnancy complications and desire to have more children.) The powerhouse couple have reportedly recently chosen a surrogate, a mom from San Diego in her late 20s. They're expecting to welcome their newest addition in January 2018, according to reports.""",/home/yanwang_nuist/dev_workspace/prj_python/fnd-bootstrap/dataset/gossip/Images/gossip_test/lFvAZD4yXTzhiaI1sWGpOOeqVfASXDkA.jpg,1.0
"""The Women of Hollywood Speak Out Studio heads may have no choice but to listen. As Kathleen Kennedy told me: ‘‘I had an agent pitching directors to me recently, and when he got done, I waited, and then I said, ‘So, do you represent any women?’ He said, ‘Oh, mmmmm.’ I had to bring it up. I think you’ve got to put pressure on them.’’ Tom Rothman, chairman of Sony Pictures, recently told The Hollywood Reporter: ‘‘There’s a myth in the business that young males drive the box office. Maybe a decade ago or so that was true. I don’t find that true now at all. I actually think women drive the box office.’’ For the moment, it seems the bandwagon is rolling. ‘‘All of a sudden, we’re in this era of, ‘Oh, my God, girls,’ ’’ Pascal told me. ‘‘It’ll last about as long as it always does: about five more minutes.’’  Soloway has become a gleeful militant with a ‘‘messianic, feminist, patriarchy-toppling dream.’’ The mother of two sons, one a 7-year-old, she wants to put a nursery on her set and has been lobbying the D.G.A. to allow two directors per episode for more flex time.  The kids question is a significant one. Several top executives talk about the problem of female directors dropping out to have families. And there is still such an atmosphere of fear that many female directors told me they hide their pregnancies until the last possible minute. One director confessed that she actually hides her child, refusing to put a photo of her son on Facebook, fearing ‘‘it could end my career.’’  ‘‘I’ve even had women executives say to me, not realizing I was a mom, ‘We always want to work with women filmmakers, but then they have kids,’ ’’ says Marielle Heller, who also directed last summer’s critically acclaimed ‘‘The Diary of a Teenage Girl.’’ ‘‘It’s a real stigma, which I think is not fair. It’s crazy to me that that’s the excuse because nobody ever asks men who have kids whether they’ll be able to do it.’’  Over lemonade at Le Pain Quotidien on Melrose Avenue, Gina Prince-Bythewood, in gilt Wonder Woman kicks, said that when she was shooting ‘‘The Secret Life of Bees’’ in North Carolina, her husband back in L.A. told her that her younger son, now 11, was walking around the house with a toy phone having a pretend conversation with her. ‘‘I had a lot of guilt; it wrecked me,’’ said the 46-year-old, who also has a 14-year-old son. ‘‘But I’m a director, and I need to feed that part of me.’’  For nearly six months now, I’ve had the voices of Prince-Bythewood and many other talented women echoing in my head. I hear them puzzling about the disparity problem and dissecting it, trying to find a way around it or plotting to go head-on against it. Dunham talks about quotas. Others pin their hopes on web disruption with new studios at Netflix and Amazon.  But, as Prince-Bythewood says, the studios should open the door for women who are in love with film and with storytelling. ‘‘Just get us in the room,’’ she says.""",/home/yanwang_nuist/dev_workspace/prj_python/fnd-bootstrap/dataset/gossip/Images/gossip_test/lHOG2SG8rEBCbL3vsQjMM95fY0xvVzI4.jpg,1.0

"""VIDEO: 'Homecoming' Teaser: Julia Roberts Is Ready to 'Get Started' “Shall we get started?”  Amazon revealed the first teaser trailer for “Homecoming,” its upcoming psychological starring Julia Roberts, during the Prime Video panel at San Diego Comic-Con 2018 on Friday. And though it only gives us a tiny glimpse of Roberts in character as caseworker Heidi Bergman (she literally just scribbles down some notes, says the above line to someone off camera and then clicks on a tape recorder) we’re already entranced by her calm, collected mannerisms. Luckily, Amazon also revealed that you won’t have to wait much longer, as “Homecoming” will premiere this November on the streaming service.  The rest of the one-minute clip promoting the mind-bending drama directed by “Mr. Robot” creator Sam Esmail, explores the abandoned halls of what we can safely assume is the titular Homecoming Transitional Support Center where Heidi workers, a Geist Group facility helping soldiers transition back to civilian life.  Also Read: 'My Best Friend's Wedding' Reunion: Dermot Mulroney Joins Julia Roberts on Amazon's 'Homecoming'  Walter Cruz (Stephan James) is one of these soldiers, eager to begin the next phase of his life. Overseeing Heidi and the facility is Colin Belfast (Bobby Cannavale), an ambitious company man whose manic demands point to questionable motives.  Four years later, Heidi has started a new life, living with her mother (Sissy Spacek) and working as a small-town waitress, when a Department of Defense auditor (Shea Whigham) comes to her with questions about why she left the Homecoming facility. Heidi begins to realize that there’s a whole other story behind the story she’s been telling herself.

For one thing, is she gay? “So it was a thing for a minute because no one ever saw me with a guy,” she tells Vogue. “I would always go that extra mile to be low-key with guys, sneaking around all the time. You don’t want to, like, look crazy.” But she essentially confirms that she is in fact dating Detroit Pistons basketball player Blake Griffin, coyly phoning from Michigan on Valentine’s Day. “I’m happy,” she finally admits. “He’s very nice. I have someone being very nice to me.” But if she weren’t dating Griffin, and if she weren’t, in fact, heterosexual, Jenner says that she isn’t the type to hide it. “I don’t think I have a bisexual or gay bone in my body, but I don’t know! Who knows?! I’m all down for experience—not against it whatsoever—but I’ve never been there before.” She has a “tough energy,” she says, but “I’m not gay. I have literally nothing to hide…. I would never hide something like that.”  As for the Pepsi ad heard round the world, Jenner had a difficult time in the fallout. “Obviously, my intention was not to hurt anyone,” she says. “Honestly, I just hid out. It hurt me that I hurt other people…. I’ve been yelled at before, stepped in controversy before, but nothing to that extent. You can never really prepare for something like that.” But she has learned, as “a huge people pleaser,” to be more aware of goings on on set, where, she said, “I need to be more present and pay more attention.”  One thing Jenner isn’t mincing her words over is whether she’ll be joining her sisters in their very contemporaneous pregnancies. “I am ready to wait,” she clarifies, having just bought a new home and forming plans to maybe begin competing as an equestrian under an androgynous alias. “I want to have kids, but at, like, 28 or 29.”  Watch Kendall Jenner Ask Herself Some Existential Questions:""",/home/yanwang_nuist/dev_workspace/prj_python/fnd-bootstrap/dataset/gossip/Images/gossip_test/Z4xRlnxTpT4HEhGrylqMxdngf23MCQhv.jpg,0.0

"""9 Things Selena Gomez Did to Get the Body She Has Now Last April, Selena Gomez was photographed while on vacation in Mexico. She was wearing a swimsuit, which is normal vacation behavior. But Selena isn't any ordinary human, and internet trolls pounced on the chance to tear Selena apart for looking """"fat"""" in paparazzi photos.  She handled the body-shaming by posting a personal bathing suit shot to Instagram, which she captioned, """"I love being happy with me yall,"""" along with the hashtag #TheresMoreToLove.  But that was last year and this is now. And while she's always looked stunning, at the start of her worldwide solo tour, Selena has visibly less to love.  Getty  Getty  Her changed body is the result of over a year working with trainer Amy Rosoff Davis, who has not only been looking after the singer's fitness but also her diet and lifestyle.  Since starting last spring, Selena has worked out with Amy anywhere from three to five days a week, and in the last couple months before the start of the """"Revival"""" tour, they were working out seven days a week for up to two hours at a time — on top of which Selena was doing back-to-back run-throughs of her 90-minute show during rehearsal. While on tour with Selena in Sacramento, California, Amy spoke to Cosmopolitan.com about what Selena did to get the body she has now.  Getty  Getty | Krystalina Tom  1. No weighing. """"I've never weighed her,"""" Amy said. """"I don't believe in scales — I just don't think it's healthy."""" But, because she and Selena work so closely together, she can tell when Selena's body changes or when her clothes fit differently, which they have been. """"I can definitely see the difference, and other people can too,"""" she said. """"But ultimately, a body that eats well and works is going to look better because it's healthy.""""  Getty  2. No dieting. There's nothing that's off-limits when it comes to food — although that doesn't mean Amy won't encourage better choices — there's just less of it. """"I want to live my life like a French person,"""" Amy said. """"I don't believe in denying yourself, but I also believe in moderation. Life is too short not to enjoy food.""""  3. Switch from fast food to whole food. About that: Selena speaks with pride about eating like she's from Texas. """"She loves Tex-Mex and fast food that I would normally not condone,"""" Amy said. """"I will walk onto the tour bus and smell fast food, throw it in the trash, and hand her a carrot and hummus."""" Changing Selena's eating habits has helped a lot in shaping her physique, Amy said. """"She responds really quickly. We'll do barely any ab exercises and two days later, I'm like, 'Whoa!'""""  Amy has been incorporating more whole foods and healthy organic ingredients into Selena's meals. Here's a breakdown of what Selena might eat in a day:  Breakfast: Half of a healthy breakfast burrito of scrambled eggs, chorizo, avocado, rice, and beans; or, full-fat Greek yogurt and granola.  Courtesy of Amy Rosoff Davis  Lunch: A """"power salad"""" of turkey, avocado, beans, with a homemade dressing of red wine vinegar, olive oil, dijon mustard, and lemon juice.  Dinner: Teriyaki bowl with Asian-marinated cucumber, salmon or chicken, avocado, and teriyaki sauce over rice; or sushi.  Amy Rosoff Davis  Selena also has a juicer in her dressing room so she can have a juice before she goes on stage. Amy's been making her juices with cucumber, carrot, kale, and ginger. Not that Selena is necessarily into it, but it's what she's doing right now.  4. Never let your body get bored. Selena has been doing cardio, Pilates, and yoga of all kinds.  She and Amy go on long hikes with some of Selena's crew, where they'll break to do circuit training and """"arm dancing"""" and """"side chassés up a hill."""" Amy said, """"I've always believed the best way to keep your muscles active is to mix it up. We switch things up almost every day.""""  Courtesy of Amy Rosoff Davis  5. Stretch. A lot. Amy stresses the importance of having a limber body and says that becoming more flexible has helped Selena """"let go."""" Sometimes, Selena will even do a combined stretching and vocal warmup session.  Courtesy of Amy Rosoff Davis  Courtesy of Amy Rosoff Davis  Courtesy of Amy Rosoff Davis  6. Water, water, water. """"I'm a big water pusher,"""" Amy said. """"All the time. I'm always putting a bottle of water in someone's hand."""" It's clearly worked. Selena toldVogue that """"I always have water, tons of water. It's even in my bathroom because I used to be so bad at drinking water and I want to stay hydrated.""""  Getty  7. Sweat it out. Amy introduced Selena to Shape House, an """"urban sweat lodge"""" where clients lie for 55 minutes in an """"infrared burrito"""" and leave with skin that is """"literally glowing,"""" Amy said. According to Shape House's website, one """"typical sweat session burns between 800 to 1,600 calories."""" Selena loves the process of infrared sweating so much that she has a sweat bag for the road.  8. Have a healthy body image. """"When you feel good, you exude confidence, and you feel strong and healthy,"""" Amy said. """"You wear it well inside and outside of your skin.""""  9. Nourish the body and soul. While they were in Northern California, Amy researched good spots to hike, and it's a practice she hopes to continue throughout the whole tour. """"We want to find beautiful things in each town that makes it what it is,"""" she said. """"You're in a hotel, or you're on a bus or in a show for so much of the time that it's nice to get out in nature where there's no technology and no people."""" After the two-hour hike outside Sacramento, they stopped at a waterfall and stood there for a few minutes to breathe and watch the water. """"It was such a perfect combination of mind, body, and soul,"""" Amy said. """"Health, fitness, food — all of it is so important. What we put in our mouths and our souls affects everything.""""

"""Property Brothers' Drew Scott Is Engaged to Linda Phan Sorry, ladies, Drew Scott is officially off the market!  The Property Brothers star proposed to longtime girlfriend Linda Phan at the Toronto restaurant Piano Piano, and PEOPLE can exclusively announce the pair are engaged.  “I’ve never met another woman like her and once you do, you want to be with her forever,” Scott, 38, tells PEOPLE of Phan, 31.  Scott has been planning the elaborate surprise for weeks, and was determined to keep his new fiancé off his trail as he coordinated every over-the-top moment. “I’ve had to be as stealthy as a ninja to pull this off,” he says. Scott even admitted he’s been carrying the ring around with him for weeks and has kept all planning offline so Phan couldn’t possibly come across any details accidentally.  The HGTV star, who has released two country singles with brother Jonathan, recently snuck off to New York City to record his own version of the Train song “Marry Me.” During tonight’s dinner, he arranged for the restaurant to play the track while he and Phan were having dinner, which cued the staff to bring out a cake decorated with illustrations from one of Phan’s favorite books, Dr. Seuss’s Oh the Places You’ll Go, tweaked to read “Oh the Places We’ll Go,” as a nod to their continuing journey together.  The festivities continued after dinner with a surprise engagement party at a nearby venue that Phan had been led to believe was a company holiday party. Friends and family, including both fiancés’ parents, as well as Scott siblings Jonathan and J.D., were all in attendance.

"""It’s Official: The Royals Will Spend Christmas Together, and Maybe End the Feud Rumors for Good Christmas is a time for goodwill, seasonal cheer, and forgiveness, so it seems fitting that the royal family is set to move past some recent rumors to once again celebrate Christmas en masse at the royal estate of Sandringham.  Despite talk of sibling rivalry, tearful duchesses, and diva-like behavior in the court of Kensington Palace, William and Kate Middleton and Harry and Meghan Markle will be together on Christmas Day, the Palace has confirmed. The news comes just after Kensington Palace attempted to snuff out reports of difficulty between the duchesses with a terse comment to The Sun over the weekend.  Although it is William and Kate’s turn to visit the Middletons this year (they usually alternate Christmas between their two families and spent Christmas with the Queen last year), royal sources say that they have decided to join the royal family for Christmas Day.  It is believed they will then head to Bucklebury, Kate’s parents’ hometown, to enjoy a second Christmas with her family.  Kate’s mother, Carole Middleton, revealed in her first-ever interview, published in The Daily Telegraph over the weekend, that she has prepared an extra-special Christmas this year to welcome the two newest family members, her grandsons Prince Louis and Arthur, son of Pippa Middleton.  There will be no fewer than 12 Christmas trees at Bucklebury Manor, the Middleton family’s home, with one just for Prince George to decorate, but the Cambridges will have to skip the Middletons’ traditional smoked salmon and Champagne brunch on Christmas morning because they will be with the Queen and the rest of the royal family at church in Norfolk. It will be the first time the Cambridges and the Sussexes, a.k.a the “Fab Four,” will have been pictured together since reports of a simmering feud rocked the Palace.  It was reported this weekend that courtiers have launched a “mole hunt” to try to uncover who has been leaking stories of tensions between Harry and William and Kate and Meghan. Reports of discord between the couples emerged after Kensington Palace announced last weekend that the Duke and Duchess of Sussex would be moving out of Kensington Palace in the new year and into Frogmore House in Windsor.  Since then it has been claimed that Kate and Meghan don’t get along and that the brothers have fallen out because William voiced concerns about how quickly Harry’s relationship with Meghan was moving.  The Queen, who dislikes any rumors of discord regarding her family, will no doubt be relieved that the family will be coming together on Christmas Day. After the family celebrates with a turkey dinner on Christmas Eve, the sight of the foursome at church on Christmas morning will, courtiers hope, put an end to the unhappy narrative that the couples have fallen out.

"""Paris Jackson addresses family issues after Janet Jackson performance Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window)  Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window)  Paris Jackson praised her aunt Janet Jackson’s Billboard Music Awards performance on social media, but when she wasn’t seen in the audience alongside grandmother Katherine Jackson, brother Prince Jackson and aunt Rebbie Jackson while Janet accepted her Billboard Icon Award, fans questioned her family loyalty.  Paris, the 20-year-old daughter of the late Michael Jackson, address her critics on social media, telling them not to worry about her or her family’s business.  “Dear social media followers, friends, stalkers, lovers and haters, and fellow moonwalkers: Please do not tell me/demands/try to control how I handle my relationship with the people in my life, specifically my family,” she wrote in an Instagram Story.  “As amazing and as s—-y as things can be, it is no one’s business but ours. I understand that some of you feel some sort of connection or need to be a part of our lives considering you watched us grow up. However, I am handling my situation exactly how my father did. And I am happy keeping it that way. I will always have love and respect for my family. ALWAYS.”  The model expressed awareness of her family’s drama always playing out publicly, but reinforced that familial issues aren’t uncommon.  “Every family has their moments of trauma, heartbreak, separation, love, oneness, tribe, pain, everything. EVERY FAMILY. My family, specifically, and a good number of others…well, our drama is broadcasted worldwide through media,” Paris continued. “But that doesn’t mean our family issues are any different from yours. Ours are just made public.”  “Every level has another devil. Every life has their own s–t to deal with. We ain’t inferior or superior to y’all. We’re all f–king human. So let’s act like it.

The FCC is proposing to do away with the main studio rule, requiring each TV station to have a main studio near its local community. The idea behind the rule, adopted over 70 years ago, was to keep stations accessible to the community, before modern technology made such communication easier. “Broadcasters have shown that the main studio rule is a continuous cost that keeps them from serving their local communities in meaningful ways, like broadcasting additional local programming,” said FCC chairman Ajit Pai on Thursday. “Today’s notice is an important step toward bringing the FCC’s media rules into the digital age.” Instead of spending money on a “for your consideration” Emmy push, the creative team behind CBS comedy Mom is making a $250,000 donation to launch a public support campaign for political target Planned Parenthood.

"""Jennifer Garner Stays Warm With Intense Over-Sized Scarf -- See the Pic! The sun may be shining in Los Angeles, but there's still a cool breeze.  Jennifer Garner stayed warm and cozy on Tuesday by wearing a multi-colored and oversized scarf (reminiscent of Lenny Kravitz's infamous outerwear he wore in 2012) while out with her gal pals in L.A. on her birthday. The former Alias star, who turned 46 this week, outfitted the knitted scarf with sporty black leggings, a gray zip-up jacket, red-white-and-blue sneakers and tortoiseshell shades. Her brunette tresses were up in a long ponytail and she carried a water bottle, coffee cup and her phone in one hand.  BG004/Bauer-Griffin/GC Images  Garner later revealed on Instagram that that the massive scarf was a birthday gift from her daughter Seraphina.  """"When your nine year old weaves a 12ft long scarf on a peg loom for your birthday present, you’d better #werk #fashionfriday #thecarpoollineismyrunway #proudmom,"""" she captioned another pic of her colorful fashion statement.  The actress appeared to have been in good spirits during her birthday, turning herself into a meme and taking to Instagram to thank everyone for their well wishes.  """"I’m having the best birthday and so much of it is because of all of you. Thank you for the birthday love! ❤️❤️❤️,"""" she wrote alongside the silly pic of herself doing her hair.  Undoubtedly, 46 will be a good year for Garner as she makes her return to television with the series Camping, will kick-ass in the spy-thrillerPeppermint, and continues to treat fans to all her wonderful Instagram videos and pics.

"""Broadway Alum & Oscar Nominee Emma Stone Eyes La La Land Movie Musical Emma Stone must have had a perfectly marvelous time headlining a tuner! The Broadway alum and Oscar nominee is in talks to headline the film musical La La Land. According to The Wrap, Damien Chazelle’s song-and-dance romance has also eyed both Ryan Gosling and Tony winner Eddie Redmayne for the male lead.    Stone would play wannabe actress Mia, who is anxious to fit in. She falls in love with Sebastian, a magnetic jazz musician, in Los Angeles, but the city that united them may split them up. Emma Watson was originally tapped for the role of Mia, before taking on Belle in Beauty and the Beast instead.  We were recently happy to see Stone make her Broadway debut in Cabaret. Oscar nominated for Birdman, her additional screen credits include the Amazing Spider-Man film series, Magic in the Moonlight, The Croods, Gangster Squad, Easy A, The Help, Crazy, Stupid, Love, Friends with Benefits, Paperman, Marmaduke, Zombieland, Ghosts of Girlfriends Past, The House Bunny, The Rocker and Superbad.""",/home/yanwang_nuist/dev_workspace/prj_python/fnd-bootstrap/dataset/gossip/Images/gossip_test/x3noePjJHI6PcHUkWn2g6Mk2sbmbtIQN.jpg,1.0
"""All Apologies: 22 Times Justin Bieber Said ‘Sorry’ The road to Justin Bieber‘s upcoming album Purpose has been an apologetic one. In fact, saying that he’s sorry for his past has been one of the premiere promotional tools for his highly-anticipated follow-up to 2013 compilation Journals.  Even before he kicked off his notorious string of bad behavior in 2013 and 2014, however, Bieber has been offering mea culpas to fans for his actions, whether intentionally or accidentally terrible. Here are 22 of the 22-year-old’s best apologies.  1. Apology for ignoring British fans (2010)  “Wish I could have come out from the performance at the Mayfair but security wouldn’t let me. For those girls who cursed me out for it, I’m sorry, but sometimes I need to listen to security so no one gets hurt. But I like your attitude. The UK goes hard.”  2. Apology for ignoring Brazilian fans (2011)  “Love when the press think I’m annoyed because I look tired. I’m just tired. It’s normal. I’m not a machine. I’m in Brazil!! Not annoyed. I’m excited.”  3. Apology for ignoring French fans (2012)  “The other day in the airport I got surrounded by 20 paps. I don’t like small spaces, and I just wanted to get on the plane. I ran to get through the gate and there is a video of me running by fans and on the other side you don’t see the 20 paps. I would never run by my fans. For those that I did pass that day I AM SORRY. I know my fans are my everything. I know my responsibility to love them. I LOVE MY BELIEBERS.”  4. Apology for flipping off paparazzi (2011)  “Had a great bday and at the end of the night [Selena and I] got surrounded by paps and I reacted in a way I know better. I’m sorry. #killthemwithkindness. It’s not always easy but I know better than to react in anger.”  5. Apology for throwing up onstage (2012)  “I know that you guys don’t judge me, do you? You love me just the same, even though I’m throwing up all over the stage. You love me that much?”  6. Apology to Bill Clinton after cussing him out on video (2013)  “Thanks for taking the time to talk, Mr. President. Your words meant a lot. #greatguy”  7. Apology for canceled show (2015)  “I look forward to the opportunity to give my UK beliebers a great show in the near future and hope to honor my commitment to [the Prince’s] Trust at that time.”  8. Apology for canceled TV appearance (2010)  “Just want to let my people in Germany know I won’t be on Wetten Dass tonight as an accident has taken place and we all don’t think it is right to continue … I’m sorry we couldn’t perform tonight but some things are more important than putting on a show.”  9. Apology for smoking weed (2013)  “I also heard he got busted for smoking weed,” Bieber said in a Saturday Night Live sketch in reference to himself. “And he’s really sorry about it. And people make mistakes. And he’s never gonna do it again.”  10. Apology to China and Japan after visiting a controversial Tokyo shrine honoring fallen WWII soldiers, including war criminals (2014)  “While in Japan, I asked my driver to pull over for which I saw a beautiful shrine. I was misled to think the Shrines were only a place of prayer. To anyone I have offended, I am extremely sorry. I love you China and I love you Japan.”  11. Apology to Argentina for mishandling the country’s flag onstage (2013)  “People throw stuff on my stage all show and I get it to the stage hands to get off so no one got hurt. That video I saw a bra and thought it was a shirt. I’m being told by my team it was a shirt, but even if it was a flag I would never do anything to disrespect Argentina or the fans.”  12. Apology for walking off stage (2015)  “Sadly, it’s been a rough week for me, long days no sleep while having to be ‘on’ as they would say for cameras, fans, etc. In no way did I mean to come across mean but chose to end the show as the people in the front row would not listen … I don’t always handle things the right way but I’m human and I’m working on getting better at responding, not reacting.”  13. Apology for naked butt (2015)  “I deleted the photo of my butt on Instagram not because I thought it was bad but someone close to me’s daughter follows me and she was embarrassed that she saw my butt and I totally wasn’t thinking in that aspect. I felt awful that she felt bad. To anyone I may have offended I’m so sorry. It was completely pure-hearted as a joke but didn’t take in account there are littles following me!!!”  14. Apology to Love Live anime fans for a poorly worded tweet  “I’m really sorry for getting my otaku Beliebers’ hopes up, but I’m still not really sure which words in a sentence you need to capitalize so it ended up looking like I tweeted the title of the show.”  15. Apology for racist joke (2014)  “As a kid, I didn’t understand the power of certain words and how they can hurt. I thought it was okay to repeat hurtful words and jokes but didn’t realize at the time that it wasn’t funny and that in fact my actions were continuing ignorance.”  16. Apology for another racist joke (2014)  “Facing my mistakes from years ago has been one of the hardest things I’ve ever dealt with. But I feel now that I need to take responsibility for those mistakes and not let them linger. I just hope that the next 14-year-old kid who doesn’t understand the power of these words does not make the same mistakes I made years ago. At the end of the day I just need to step down and own what I did.”  17. Apology to Ellen (2015)  “I think it’s just cool to be able to laugh at yourself. I’ve done some things. That might not of been the greatest. I just want to be able to own up to some of the things.”  18. Apology for appearance on Ellen (2015)  “It’s been a minute since I’ve done a public appearance, and I didn’t want to come off arrogant or conceited or basically how I’ve been acting the past year, year and a half.”  19. Apology for apologizing (2015)  “People often forget that [I’m human], even with their comments and stuff they think it doesn’t get to me, but it gets to me. Things that people say bother me, and I gotta be strong enough to keep it pushing. That’s why I wanted to make a video, just to let people know that I’m human … I’m passionate about being better and growing so I think that this is going to be an awesome chapter in my life.”  20. Apology at Comedy Central Roast (2015)  “There was really no preparing me for this life. I was thrown into this at 12-years-old and didn’t really know what I was getting into. There’s been moments I’m really proud of and moments I’m pretty disappointed in myself for.”  21. Apology to mom (2015)  “If it wasn’t for this woman, let’s just say I would have had a way LONGER stupid phase. I love you and thank you for not giving up on me!”  22. Apology for not apologizing (2015)  “Is it too late now to say sorry? Yeah I know that I let you down. Is it too late to say I’m sorry now?”""",/home/yanwang_nuist/dev_workspace/prj_python/fnd-bootstrap/dataset/gossip/Images/gossip_test/g548NksZazEjHeWGUcX0GfB34kBSWoVM.jpg,1.0
"""Cost of the royal wedding for Meghan Markle and Prince Harry The royal wedding is a multi-million dollar affair. Chris Jackson / Getty  The average cost of a wedding for couples in the US and the UK is around $34,000 (£23,700).  Five figures is a huge expense for a one-day affair. That is, unless you're ultra-rich — and especially if you're royalty rich.  Next month, the world will bear witness to the most anticipated royal wedding in years. Meghan Markle and Prince Harry are set to be married on May 19 at St. George's Chapel, in Windsor, and will begin a carriage procession immediately after the ceremony. Their reception will take place later on the grounds of Windsor Castle.  Kensington Palace will cover the cost of the wedding, an expense traditionally taken on by the bride's family.  The case was the same for Kate Middleton and Prince William's 2011 royal wedding— the only item Middleton paid for was her six-figure Alexander McQueen dress. Their total wedding celebration cost $34 million (£23.7 million).  Markle and Prince Harry's wedding will reportedly cost in excess of $45.8 million (£32 million), according to Bride Book's estimation. That's over 1,000 more than the average wedding.  The venue is the biggest part of a typical wedding budget for couples in the US and the UK, taking up nearly half of the entire wedding cost. Access to St. George's Chapel — and St. George's Great Hall, where the wedding reception will take place — is free of charge for Markle and Prince Harry. Transportation is also free, thanks to the Queen's fleet of Rolls-Royces, Daimlers, and Bentleys.  The greatest cost for the royal couple? Security. Protecting Markle and Prince Harry, plus thousands of guests and onlookers, will run Kensington Palace a whopping $43 million (£30 million), estimates Bride Book. That includes the cost of snipers, undercover police, military technology, and security drones. The bulk of Kate Middleton and Prince William's wedding budget similarly went to security costs.  Otherwise, Markle and Prince Harry's total wedding spend, including food, cakes, entertainment, wardrobe, and the honeymoon, amounts to about $2.8 million.  Below, check out Bride Book's breakdown of what the royal wedding will cost.""",/home/yanwang_nuist/dev_workspace/prj_python/fnd-bootstrap/dataset/gossip/Images/gossip_test/oxrEGRkSHN2Rajiw4TssT3SARMmK86Cp.jpg,1.0
"""The Real Reason Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez Didn't Spend Thanksgiving Together Although Selena Gomez and Justin Bieber have been pretty much inseperable over the past month ever since they reunited in October, the pair spent Thanksgiving apart.  Justin spent the holiday playing hockey with some high school students in his home country of Canada, while Selena spent the day with family in her home state of Texas.  So, why did Jelena decide to spend the holidays apart? Is there trouble in paradise already?  Nope. There's that's definitely not what's happening here. “They are still doing really well together,"""" a source close to the couple told E! News. """"They agreed it was best for them to be with their families for the holiday.”  Apparently, Sel decided having a joint Thanksgiving would be jumping the gun this early on in their rekindled relationship. “Selena felt it was too soon for Justin to come to Texas with her,” another insider added. “Her family is still getting comfortable with the idea of them back together.”  Fair enough. After all, the pair are still in their honeymoon phase. It makes sense to wait a while before getting family involved.  Despite spending the holidays apart, Justin and Selena reportedly stayed in touch the whole time through FaceTime. Justin is hoping he could get an invite to a future family holiday with Sel in the future.  “Justin says he hopes he can spend Christmas with her but knows that it will take a very long time for her family to accept him back in,” the source shared.

"""Katherine McPhee and David Foster engaged, make May-December romance official She may be half his age, but it looks like she's all-in on this relationship.  At age 34, Katharine McPhee is engaged to her boyfriend, 68-year-old David Foster.  A rep for the former “American Idol” star confirmed the engagement with Fox News Wednesday.  TMZ reported the celebrated music producer popped the question during their European vacation.  While it’s unknown which day he proposed, the celebrity gossip site claimed McPhee was flaunting her engagement ring while on the Italian island of Capri Sunday. She was also allegedly showing off her rock to family and friends on FaceTime.  This will be McPhee’s second marriage and Foster’s fifth. The music mogul was previously married to B.J. Cook, Rebecca Dyer, Linda Thompson and Yolanda Hadid.  The couple first sparked dating rumors in May 2017, but wouldn’t confirm their relationship until late last year.  In October, Foster’s 35-year-old daughter Erin praised McPhee to People Magazine.  “She’s amazing,” gushed Erin at the time. “I really like her. She’s awesome. My dad is kind of a hopeless romantic, and Katherine’s awesome. We really, really like her, and we’ve known her for a really long time. And if he’s happy, we’re happy.”  And McPhee hasn't been shy about praising her beau.  “… I just pinch myself when I get to spend time with him on a personal level,” McPhee told Entertainment Tonight in September. “I love his outlook on life and how he treats people. He’s really a special person in my life.  """"What I’ve learned from him is how lucky we are to do what we do. He’s always reminding me and it’s comforting to know that it’s people to walk through this life he’s had – working with incredible people, being friends with ex-presidents and world leaders – and still have that perspective. He’s so well-connected, but still just a simple guy from Canada with his little Canadian accent!”  McPhee also told Health magazine in December she has known Foster for years. The couple previously collaborated for a few live performances, including his 2008 PBS tribute concert “Hit Man: David Foster & Friends.”  “We’re very close friends, and we’ve been friends for a long time,” said the “American Idol” Season 5 runner-up. “I’m really, really fond of him, and I think he’s an incredible person. I’ve known him since I was 21 years old, you know? He produced my first single. So he’s been really good to me.

"""Did Princess Charlotte recite her great ancestor’s quote unknowingly? Is she advanced for her age?-Know the truths here! – Married Biography Did Princess Charlotte recite her great ancestor’s quote unknowingly? Is she advanced for her age?-Know the truths here!  Princess Charlotte’s recital?  National Enquirer this week reported that 2-year-old Princess Charlotte, the youngest and only daughter of Prince William and Princess Kate Middleton had randomly recited her grand ancestor, Queen Victoria’s quote. Queen Victoria had served as the Queen of England from 1837 to her death in 1901. The tabloid wrote that the little royal kid had shocked the palace staff members when she said what Queen Victoria used to say. Princess Charlotte was playing with a group of toddlers. After she finished playing, it seems that she looked at the royal helpers and said:  “The important thing is not what they think of me, but what I think of them.”  This quote was used by Queen Victoria in the 19th century.  Gossip Cop has spoken to a royal insider who laughed off at National Enquirer’s story. The insider also denied any such incident in the palace. The source revealed that the story of the tabloid was completely untrue. It is quite unlikely that a kid as small as Princess Charlotte could put together the words to make such a complete and articulate sentence. And then to repeat what was said almost a century ago is very far-fetched.  Is Princess Charlotte advanced for her age?  Last September, Princess Charlotte had accompanied her parents and brother to Canada. At a royal garden party, Princess Charlotte had mingled with other children and toddlers. Princess Charlotte moved around confidently round the garden lawn and engaged herself with the surroundings. She was just 16 years old when she went to Canada for this tour. But it was clearly seen that instead of the wobbly walk of any her age child, Princess Charlotte was walking quite sturdily and also was seen running at one point in time. She preferred balloons over bubbles. At her age, children usually can only mimic simple tasks. But Princess Charlotte was spotted trying to fold her cardigan which is quite a complex task for such a small child.  She seemed to have a good vocabulary at that age. Princess Charlotte was heard saying: dada, flower, and pop (for the balloons). Paul Kilshaw, 53, the children’s entertainer said:  “Charlotte asked for a flower, I think she said ‘flower’ because the other little girls were asking for flowers.”  She was not copying others like the other children of her age would but was inventing her own plays. She went and sat on the dog Moose. She also ran towards the balloons and started a game of her own of repeatedly hitting at them.  She also hugged the black and white rabbit around; which reveals her emotional development of passing on love to an animal. A spokesperson for the Royal family said:  “The Duke and Duchess are really pleased to have this opportunity to introduce their children to Canada and it’s great that they have the chance to play with other children while they are here.”  The show-stealer  Princess Charlotte is the show-stealer at most of the occasions. She seems to have inherited the dark Middleton eyes and her mother’s darker hairs. But she is gradually acquiring the royal genes. Her face now resembles that of her great-grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II when she was small.  Prince William dots on his little one and calls her ‘the joy from the Heaven’. Friends say that the little Princess has a bubbly and confident character, but talking about her daughter, Princess Kate had said:  “She is very cute but she has got quite a feisty side. George has turned out to be a really lovely little boy. I hope George will keep Charlotte in order!”  Princess Charlotte was the bridesmaid for her maternal aunt, Pippa Middleton at the latter’s wedding on 20th May 2017 to financier James Matthews. Princess Charlotte looked cute in her tan-and-white dress by Pepa and Co. and had worn a floral headpiece. She was also holding a tiny basket and seemed quite fond of it. The mother-daughter duo made an amazing and beautiful pair!  The little Princess had also stolen the show at the Trooping the Colour Ceremony in June 2017 at the Royal Palace. She was in a pretty baby pink dress and stood on the balcony of the Buckingham Palace along with the other royal family members, enjoying the military specter.  The Princess’ life at Anmer Hall  For the last two years, Princess Charlotte had stayed with her parents and brother at Anmer Hall, her parents’ 10-bedroom mansion at Norfolk, England. It was a simple life there with Kate managing the whole show alone. She had her royal servants and her children’s nanny. An insider told People:  “There was no formality at all. It really was like any other family sitting down to lunch, with George and Charlotte eating their homemade food in their high chairs and toddling around with their toys.”  He added:  “You’d think that Kate and William would have an army of staff to help them out, but it really was just them and the children,”  Another family friend said:""",/home/yanwang_nuist/dev_workspace/prj_python/fnd-bootstrap/dataset/gossip/Images/gossip_test/ck0yyBC7ycR0yXeRnqVA5rctPgABXzu3.jpg,1.0

Chris Pizzello/Invision/AP  Laura Dern won an Emmy Sunday night for her supporting role in HBO's """"Big Little Lies."""" And while she thanked her co-stars (many of them nominees as well) in her speech, she may have snubbed one of them on her way to the stage.  In the CBS broadcast of her winning the award, it shows Dern hugging co-stars Nicole Kidman and Shailene Woodley (who she beat in the category of supporting actress in a limited TV series or movie), but skipping over Reese Witherspoon, who also starred in """"Big Little Lies.""""  People are freaking out over the apparent snub.  A more likely solution is that the aired footage simply didn't show the hug between Witherspoon and Dern. At the beginning of the shot where Dern hugs her co-stars, it looks like she's pulling away from Witherspoon, as if they had just embraced.  Laura Dern getting up, probably from hugging Reese Witherspoon. CBS  It's also possible that Dern was just gripping the seat in front of her as she was getting up. It's not totally clear.  Dern also, after all, did give a shoutout to Witherspoon in her speech. """"I share this with my tribe of four ladies,"""" she said, referring to her co-stars Witherspoon, Kidman, Woodley, and Zoe Kravitz. So there probably isn't any beef between them.  Also, it's just kind of awkward to hug someone in the seat in front of you. The chair is in the way. What's she supposed to do? Like, hug the back of her neck? Tap her on the shoulder?

"""Emma Stone And Andrew Garfield Might Be Giving Their Love A Second Chance Where there was fire, ashes reman!  After officially ending their relationship in 2015, the Amazing Spider-man co-stars joined the small but growing club of celebrities with friendly separations. And it’s only clear that there’s still much love between former couple Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone.  I mean, the guy teared up when she won her Best Actress Academy Award, for crying out loud! And both Emma and Andrew have said in numerous occasions that even after their split, they still love each other very much.  Well, it seems like those weren’t just empty words.  According to The Sun, Stone has been making multiple trips to London to see Garfield perform in his play Angels in America. She’s watched the show several times and allegedly “always” goes back for a backstage visit. “They have even been sneaking out of the back door holding hands,” a source close to Garfield told the outlet.  While Emma spent some time in the UK earlier this year shooting her new film The Favourite, a further trip to London paved the way for them to reconnect. “Andrew’s feelings for Emma never softened and now they are growing close once again,” the source said.  Emma, 28, and Andrew, 34, enjoyed an on again off again romance for four years. In the early 2010’s, these two were Hollywood’s sweethearts after meeting during screentest for The Amazing Spider-Man. The couple went public in 2011, via the classy and showbiz means of a joint appearance during her Saturday Night Live monologue. Everything is love and smiles until rumors aired that the pair was taking a break from their relationship in early 2015. They finally announced their so-called definitive separation later that year.  Yet, here we are, cheering for Emma and Andrew once again.  “The familiarity they have with each other seems to bring them back to a place to try again and again. So, I wouldn’t say that they are back to being an official couple just yet, but the future is probably going to be something where they are together. It is basically just a matter of time,” the source said.

"""Megyn Kelly asks Jane Fonda about plastic surgery; schooling ensues If we learn just one thing from “Megyn Kelly Today,” the former Fox host’s new NBC project, let it be that a woman’s appearance is rarely the most interesting thing she has to talk about.  On Wednesday (day three of the new show), Kelly hosted Jane Fonda and Robert Redford to talk about “Our Souls at Night,” a new movie in which they play neighbors who fall in love.  (Count me in, by the way, for a movie in which the 81-year-old actor’s love interest is played by a 79-year-old actress.)  Kelly decided to talk about plastic surgery.  “You’ve been an example to everyone in how to age beautifully and with strength and unapologetically,” she said to Fonda. (As opposed to apologizing, I guess, for living past 43?)  “You admit you’ve had work done, which I think is to your credit,” Kelly continued, as Fonda’s face begins to register slight shock. “But you look amazing. Why did you say, I read that you said you felt — you’re not proud to admit you’ve had work done. Why not?""""  Fonda stared at Kelly the way you stare at people who start telling you what they dreamed last night.  “We really want to talk about that now?”  (Pivot, I wanted to scream at the screen. Pivot, Megyn, Pivot!)  Jane Fonda recalls the moment she knew Robert Redford would be a star. (""""Megyn Kelly Today"""") Jane Fonda recalls the moment she knew Robert Redford would be a star. (""""Megyn Kelly Today"""") SEE MORE VIDEOS  But she forged ahead: “Well, one of the things people think about when they look at you is how amazing you look.”  But here she is on your show, Meg. With words to say. And a voice to say them. We don’t have to focus on how she looks — she’s not a picture. We can focus on what she’s created, what she’s accomplished, what she’s thinking.  Fonda took it upon herself to pivot: “Well, thanks,” she replied. “Good attitude, good posture, take care of myself. But let me tell you why I love this movie that we did, ‘Our Souls at Night.’ Rather than plastic surgery.”  Kelly is going for a whole new audience and a whole new feel on NBC.  “The truth is, I am kind of done with politics for now,” she told the audience Monday.  “If my producers and I do our jobs,” she said that first day, “you will find out what you need to know today, to get yourself through the day — to have a laugh with us, a smile, sometimes a tear. And maybe a little hope to start your day.”  Lighter stuff. I can see how she got the impression that she should chat with the gals about their appearance. The New York Times profiled Cindi Leive when she stepped down from Glamour early this month and managed to work this into the fifth paragraph:  “Her toenails were painted a bluish gray. They looked perfectly nice but still ready for a fresh pedicure.”  And, a few paragraphs later, “Ms. Leive’s stomach growled beneath her flouncy Tanya Taylor dress, with its cutout shoulders. She drank water.”  (I checked twice to make sure I wasn’t reading The Onion.)  Hopefully, Wednesday’s awkward on-air exchange keeps Kelly from going down a similarly narrow path.  Ask about her work. Ask about her life. Ask her what she’s reading. Just don’t reduce her to a pretty face.  hstevens@chicagotribune.com  Twitter @heidistevens13  Related: For better or worse, we'll never see another Hef »  Jane Fonda's frank sex toy talk opens the door for a generation »  The perfect response to Hurricane Harvey 'gender studies professor' tweet »""",/home/yanwang_nuist/dev_workspace/prj_python/fnd-bootstrap/dataset/gossip/Images/gossip_test/pENYgldYk56szGBAPTpsWOFPZvFPPqMR.jpg,1.0
"""Gwyneth Paltrow helps Stephen Colbert mock Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop lifestyle South African middle-distance runner Caster Semenya, who has two Olympic gold medals in the 800-meter competition, received news on Wednesday that could severely alter the course of her illustrious career — and it's already stirred quite a debate in the sports world.  Semenya had appealed a new rule instituted by the International Association of Athletics Federation which would force female runners like Semenya, who have naturally elevated levels of testosterone, to take testosterone blockers to compete in races from 400 meters to a mile. But the Court of Arbitration for Sport denied the appeal, which means the 28-year-old Semenya will either have to take the medication or stop competing altogether. Either way, the ruling is surely a blow to one of the sport's most gifted athletes just one year before the next Olympics.  Some observers, including famed American sprinter Michael Johnson, said that while it was no fault of Semenya's, the court's ruling was the only way to ensure fair competition.  ‘She's just able to produce certain performances that we could never contend with.’ Here’s what British runner Marilyn Okoro said about Caster Semenya, who today lost her appeal against the IAAF https://t.co/ZUoTacP7WH pic.twitter.com/O6nWVKquzP — ITV News (@itvnews) May 1, 2019  Semenya has plenty of supporters, however, especially in her home country of South Africa. Several analysts have also pointed out that biology creates advantages for athletes in nearly every sport. USA Today's Nancy Armour, for example, asks what the reaction would be if legendary U.S. swimmer Michael Phelps was banned from competing because of his preternaturally long wingspan.  Others say the IAAF's decision could have other consequences beyond athletic records: One doctor says it could ultimately be a choice between competing and caring for her mental health.

"""Life, Movies & Family Born in Houston, Texas, Beyoncé Knowles first captured the public's eye as lead vocalist of the R&B group Destiny's Child. She later established a solo career with her debut album Dangerously in Love, becoming one of music's top-selling artists with sold-out tours and a slew of awards. Knowles has also starred in several films, including Dream Girls. She married hip-hop recording artist Jay-Z in 2008. In late 2013, she surprised audiences by releasing her fifth studio album, self-titled Beyoncé, and has twice performed at the Super Bowl. She released her sixth studio album, Lemonade, after the airing of an HBO special in April 2016, and two years later she dropped a joint album with Jay-Z, Everything Is Love, while the two were on tour.  Singer and actress Beyoncé Giselle Knowles was born on September 4, 1981, in Houston, Texas. She started singing at an early age, competing in local talent shows and winning many of these events by impressing audiences with her singing and dancing abilities.  On the musical front, Beyoncé took center stage as a solo artist, releasing her first album, Dangerously in Love, in 2003. The recording became a huge success for her both commercially and critically. It sold millions of copies and won five Grammy Awards. On the album, Beyoncé worked with a number of different artists, including Missy Elliott , Sean Paul and Jay-Z. She was rumored to be dating Jay-Z around this time, but the couple did not publicly acknowledge their relationship.  While enjoying her group's success, Beyoncé began exploring other projects. She made her acting debut in 2001 with a starring role in MTV's Carmen: A Hip Hopera. She then co-starred with Mike Myers in the Austin Powers spy parody Goldmember the following year.  Teaming up with her cousin, Kelly Rowland , and two classmates, Beyoncé formed an all-female singing group. Her father, Matthew Knowles, served as the band's manager. The group went through some name and line-up changes before landing a record deal in 1997 with Columbia Records. Destiny's Child soon became one of the most popular R&B acts, with the release of their first, self-titled album. Gaining momentum, the group scored its first No. 1 single on the pop charts with """"Bills, Bills, Bills,"""" off their second album. The recording also featured another smash hit, """"Say My Name.""""  On her own, Beyoncé continued to enjoy great success. Her second studio album, 2006's B'Day featured such hits as """"Irreplaceable"""" and """"Deja Vu."""" On the big screen, she starred opposite Jennifer Hudson, Jaime Foxx and Eddie Murphy in Dreamgirls. The film was adapted from the hit Broadway musical of the same name.  Beyoncé and Jay-Z  In 2008, Beyoncé married rapper and music mogul Jay-Z in a small, private ceremony in New York City. Among the guests sighted at the wedding were Beyoncé's mother, Tina Knowles; her father and manager, Matthew; her sister, Solange; Destiny's Child members Kelly Rowland and Michelle Williams; and friend Gwyneth Paltrow.  The newlywed continued to work as hard as ever, promoting her latest effort, I am ... Sasha Fierce (2008). Beyoncé scored two big hits off the album—""""Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)"""" and """"If I Were a Boy."""" She also returned to the big screen that year, starring as R&B legend Etta James in Cadillac Records. The following January, Beyoncé sang James' trademark song, """"At Last,"""" for President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama at his inaugural ball.  In addition to acting and performing, Beyoncé ran a clothing line called House of Dereon with her mother. She also launched her own fragrance, Heat, in 2010. Throughout her career, Beyoncé has served as a spokesperson and model for several other brands, including L'Oreal and Tommy Hilfiger.  Beyoncé found herself under fire after performing a private concert for Libyan leader Muammar al-Qaddafi on New Year's Eve in 2010. She later donated her fee from the event to help victims of the Haitian earthquake. According to some reports, Beyoncé said that her father had been responsible for arranging the Libyan concert. She decided to drop her father as her manager in March 2011. Later that year, Beyoncé reached the top of the album charts with her latest solo release, 4.  In January 2013, Beyoncé generated some negative headlines for her performance at President Obama's second inauguration in Washington, D.C. She was criticized for reportedly pre-recording a version of """"The Star-Spangled Banner"""" and lip-syncing to her own track during the outdoor ceremony. Despite wide media coverage, in the days following the incident, Beyoncé did not publicly address the controversy.  Not long after, prior to her appearance at Super Bowl XLVII, Beyoncé performed the song live at a press conference. She explained to reporters that she had used a """"backing track"""" at the inauguration, adding that she would """"absolutely be singing live"""" at the NFL's biggest event of the year, according to The Huffington Post.  Indeed, Beyoncé more than redeemed herself in the public eye at the Super Bowl on February 3, 2013. During the event's halftime show, she took the stage and wowed the crowd, joined by her former Destiny's Child bandmates Rowland and Williams for parts of her performance. Beyoncé also announced that her next major tour would start in the spring of 2013.  Beyoncé attends TIDAL X 1015 in New York City. Photo: Theo WargoGetty Images for TIDAL  Awards, Accolades and Surprise Album  At the 2010 Grammy Awards, Beyoncé walked away with six honors—the most wins in a single night by a female artist. Her record was matched two years later by pop/soul artist Adele. In 2010, she also tied the record for most No. 1 hits on Billboard’s Pop Songs chart, which is based on radio airplay. In 2011, she made the Forbes Top 10 list of entertainment's highest-earning women. By 2013, Beyoncé had won 16 Grammys.  Beyoncé broke records once again on December 13, 2013, with her fifth studio album, self-titled Beyoncé. The album surprised fans and critics alike, as no promotion for the album had been announced prior to its release. The record, which Beyoncé called a """"visual album,"""" was released exclusively on iTunes, with physical discs available for purchase after December 18. The record-breaking album sold more than 800,000 copies throughout the weekend it was released alone.  The collection—which was the fastest-selling album ever distributed by iTunes—also marked Beyoncé's fifth studio album to debut at No. 1, making her the first woman to reach No. 1 on the Billboard 200 with her first five albums. She released the Platinum Edition of the album in 2014, and the following year won three additional Grammys, including a Best R&B Performance award for """"Drunk in Love.""""  Second Super Bowl and 'Lemonade'  In February 2016, Beyoncé returned to the Super Bowl stage, once again earning raves for her performance. This time around she appeared with Bruno Mars and Chris Martin of the band Coldplay, highlighting her new single """"Formation"""" and subsequently announcing a world tour. The tune, its video and accompanying halftime show also garnered a wave of attention for politicized lyrics and imagery touching on everything from black power to Hurricane Katrina.  Just two months later, HBO aired an hour-long Beyoncé conceptual film, Lemonade, which presented tracks from the album of the same name released immediately afterward. The cable special showcased the singer reeling from the romantic and sexual betrayal of her partner while acknowledging the strength found in communities of African-American women. Tennis star Serena Williams and young actress Quvenzhané Wallis also made appearances in the New Orleans-based project, which was helmed by a variety of directors and featured poetry from Warsan Shire.  Lemonade the album was only initially available via Tidal, the online streaming service backed by Beyoncé's spouse, Jay-Z, and then eventually became available on iTunes and Amazon with its accompanying film. Musical contributors to the project, which quickly garnered acclaim, included Jack White, The Weeknd, James Blake and Kendrick Lamar. Lemonade debuted at No. 1, making Beyoncé the only artist in history to have all of her first six studio albums reach the top of Billboard's album charts.  In February 2017, a pregnant Beyoncé delivered a surprise performance at the Grammys, singing songs from Lemonade amid a swirling spectacle of lights, holograms and backup dancers. Although she lost the coveted Album of the Year Grammy to Adele, she did take home two awards, for Best Urban Contemporary Album and Best Music Video.  Known as """"Queen Bey,"""" the famed singer readied to take on the role of a different queen with the November 2017 announcement that she was headlining a remake of Disney's The Lion King. Scheduled for a 2019 release, the live-action reboot of the 1994 animated hit will feature Beyoncé as Nala, the budding love interest of the titular character, to be played by Donald Glover.  Shortly afterward, it was revealed that Queen Bey also reigned as the highest-earning female musician of the year. According to Forbes, Beyoncé snagged $105 million in pretax income June 2016 through June 2017, a number that easily outpaced the earnings of fellow divas Adele ($69 million) and Taylor Swift ($44 million). Forbes attributed the windfall to the success of Lemonade and the singer's Formation World Tour, which grossed approximately $250 million.  Coachella, OTR II, 'Everything Is Love,' and 'Homecoming'  In March 2018, reports surfaced that Beyoncé was working on new music and preparing to hit the road with Jay-Z. Following a false alarm in which a tour announcement appeared and quickly disappeared from her Facebook page, the power couple officially announced that their On the Run II (or OTR II) Tour would kick off in Cardiff, Wales, on June 6.  One year after she canceled a planned appearance at Coachella because of her pregnancy, Beyoncé took the stage for an eagerly anticipated performance at the April 2018 music festival. The first black woman to headline the event, Beyoncé wowed attendees and critics alike with her top-shelf singing and choreography, delivering favorites like """"Crazy In Love"""" and a rendition of the civil rights anthem """"Lift Every Voice and Sing."""" She was also joined during the two-hour set by hubby Jay-Z, sister Solange and her old Destiny's Child cohorts, Rowland and Williams.  One week later, Beyoncé delivered another highly acclaimed show at the festival. While the 27-song set and guest list remained nearly identical, the headliner shook things up with her costume changes, coming across as looser and more """"off-the-cuff,"""" according to Rolling Stone.  In June, Beyoncé and Jay-Z embarked on the European leg of their 48-date tour. While they lived up to expectations with their theatrics and swagger, the couple also surprised fans with the release of their joint album, Everything Is Love, following a London show on June 16. Initially available for streaming only on the Jay-Z owned Tidal, the nine-track album was accompanied by a video for the track """"Apes**t,"""" which featured the couple and their dancers gallivanting around some of the world's most famous artworks at the Louvre in Paris.  Later in the tour, during a performance in Atlanta, Beyoncé and Jay-Z faced a potentially dangerous moment when an audience member climbed on stage and attempted to chase the stars backstage, before the backup dancers banded together to stop the intruder.  Around that time, Beyoncé earned her fourth cover spread and story for Vogue. The production made headlines for the singer's control over the photo shoot, for which she wore minimal makeup and showed off her natural hair, as well as her unfiltered interview in which she embraced her """"FUPA"""" — the leftover weight gain in the abdominal area from her pregnancy.  On April 17, 2019, Beyoncé released a Netflix documentary about her Coachella performance, 'Homecoming,' and a surprise companion album which included 40 live tracks.""",/home/yanwang_nuist/dev_workspace/prj_python/fnd-bootstrap/dataset/gossip/Images/gossip_test/jbroSkDJMuxgFrXaPgJSDrhs8dACIWHR.jpg,1.0

The former sportsman addressed drifting apart from ex brother-in-law Kanye West, 40, who is married to Khloe's sister Kim, 36.  He said: 'I would say it probably deteriorated with all the other relationships that were built. But it’s like that sometimes.'  Happy news: Khloe, 33, is four months pregnant with her first child with Cleveland Cavaliers player Tristan Thompson, 26 , who she has been dating for one year (pictured in June)  No hard feelings: The former basketball star, 37, wished his former flame well during an interview on YouTube's Complex's morning show, Everyday Struggle , on Wednesday  'Still got love for her': Odom told hosts Joe Budden, DJ Akademiks and Nadeska Alexis: 'From a distance, I wish her well. I've still got love for her'  The ex-Lakers star looked fit and well when he left his hotel in New York's Midtown on Tuesday evening.  Lamar - who raises Destiny, 19, and Lamar Jr., 16, with ex partner Liza Morales - was on his way to the Bryant Park Grill for his induction into the NYC Basketball Hall of Fame.  The athlete was followed by a gaggle of admirers, who took a few selfies with the former athlete.  Khloe and Lamar's four-year marriage was a disaster.  They walked down the aisle in Beverly Hills in 2009 just one month after meeting, only for her to see him get pulled into the drug scene and cheat on her flagrantly for years until she left him in 2013.  In happier times: Khloe and Lamar walked down the aisle in Beverly Hills in 2009 just one month after meeting, but split in 2013 (pictured February 2016)  Back to health: The ex-Lakers star looked fit and well when he left his hotel in New York's Midtown on Tuesday evening  Suited up: Lamar was on his way to the Bryant Park Grill for his induction into the NYC Basketball Hall of Fame  In 2015 he almost died from a drug overdose when he was in a Nevada brothel. She took care of him and the two seemed to rekindle their romance, but then he was seen drinking again in April 2016.  Khloe then ended things for good, divorcing the former Sixth Man player by the end of the 2016.  Khloe's baby news came to light last week, making her the third Kardashian-Jenner sister to be expecting.  Youngest sibling Kylie Jenner, 20, is pregnant with her first child with rapper boyfriend Travis Scott, 25.  Kim and Kanye - already parents to daughter North, four, and son Saint, 21 months - will welcome a baby girl via surrogate in January.""",/home/yanwang_nuist/dev_workspace/prj_python/fnd-bootstrap/dataset/gossip/Images/gossip_test/KWesNUUYKL9dtehdJogRohIkNqT5zHDh.jpg,1.0

"""Caitlyn Jenner is under fire for calling Aerosmith’s “Dude Looks Like a Lady” her theme song Caitlyn Jenner is facing criticism after joking about one of Aerosmith’s most famous — and offensive — tunes.  In the caption of a July 18 Instagram photo of Jenner posing with Aerosmith lead singer Steven Tyler, Jenner teased that the pair is working on a duet of Aerosmith’s 1987 hit “Dude (Looks Like a Lady),” which Jenner called “one of my favorite songs!”  @iamstevent and I are working on our duet for Dude Looks Like a Lady. One of my favorite songs! A post shared by Caitlyn Jenner (@caitlynjenner) on Jul 18, 2017 at 9:53am PDT  Then, during an appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live later that day, Jenner, who is a trans woman, told the story behind the snapshot and how she first came to view “Dude (Looks Like a Lady)” as her “theme song.”  Jenner revealed that the photo was taken “two nights ago” during a fundraiser in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Upon seeing Tyler perform, Jenner said she was compelled to go backstage, say hello, and tell the musician how much one of his songs had meant to her.  After telling Kimmel that before she publicly came out as a trans woman in 2015, her life was full of “secrets” and “hiding,” she recalled her conversation with Tyler:  “I said to Steven, ‘I have had some really, really tough times in my life. ... Every once in a while I would ... sneak out in the dark and drive around. And I always used to take your song, ‘Dude (Looks Like a Lady)’.”  Jenner further explained to Kimmel that “Dude (Looks Like a Lady)” became something of a personal anthem for her, “driving around in my little car with my little CD in there, whippin’ up the tunes and stuff. ... It made me feel good.”  But not every member of the LGBTQ community feels so warmly about the song.  Originally released in 1987, “Dude (Looks Like a Lady)” spent 20 weeks on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. It also experienced a second wind in 1993, after it was included on the soundtrack for the Robin Williams cross-dressing comedy Mrs. Doubtfire.  However, despite the song’s mainstream success, Aerosmith has frequently been criticized for the lyrics and music video’s offensive insinuations about trans women.  In general, the lyrics blur the lines between being a trans woman, a cross-dressing man, or a man who simply has “feminine” traits. The song also plays on the idea that trans women intentionally deceive men or are “in disguise,” that they are unattractive or repulsive (as evidenced in one of the video’s first scenes where Steven Tyler recoils at the sight of a construction worker whose gender identity is purposely unclear), and at one point mixes pronouns, going from “Oh she like it” in one line to “Oh, he was a lady,” in the next.  Given the song’s backstory, the fact that it offends many people is hardly surprising.  In an 2012 interview with SongFacts, songwriter Desmond Child, who worked with Aerosmith on the contentious track, reveals that the song was based on Tyler’s experience of once mistaking Mötley Crüe vocalist Vince Neil for a woman at a bar. After realizing who he was, Tyler and his fellow band members joked about how the “dude looked like a lady.”  Desmond goes on to share that he talked Aerosmith into the song’s story concept of “a guy that walks into a strip joint and falls in love with the stripper on stage, goes backstage and finds out it's a guy.” Though Desmond argues that “Dude (Looks Like a Lady” is “a very accepting song,” many people take issue with the reading that the trans woman stripper is “tricking” her customers, not to mention the suggestion that a trans woman is actually a man.  Trans women have long been subject to harmful misconceptions of this nature. As a result, they experience “disproportionate violence and discrimination at the hands of both strangers and intimate partners,” according to the Human Rights Campaign.  Though a representative of Jenner’s told HuffPost that there are currently no actual plans for Jenner and Tyler to record a duet, the song’s history and Jenner’s comment are still igniting heavy pushback from the LGBTQ community.  “Don't keep doing things that perpetuate the false idea that trans women are actually men,” one Reddit user wrote. “It’s making things more dangerous for every one of us that isn't protected by having a bajillion dollars and being a public figure.”  On Twitter, people have called Jenner’s comments “irresponsible.”  She just doesn't get it, does she?  Of all the songs in all Aerosmith repertoire in all the world, she had to choose this one #CaitlynJenner https://t.co/qACH6bXXGe — Mx Jigsaw (@MxJigsaw) July 19, 2017  I can't help but feel like #CaitlynJenner's recent instagram post is super irresponsible pic.twitter.com/tuAg1Bf4Kf — Forbes (@forbuss) July 18, 2017  Since coming out, several of Jenner’s public statements and stances as a celebrity trans activist have been criticized for being out of touch or simply offensive. This new controversy raises more concerns about how accurately and responsibly Jenner presents her own community, especially considering the danger that trans women face when the “realness” of their womanhood is challenged.""",/home/yanwang_nuist/dev_workspace/prj_python/fnd-bootstrap/dataset/gossip/Images/gossip_test/xlvWVUmoU7yf0r5vOton6lbQtq7IRMMM.jpg,0.0
"""List of The Simpsons guest stars (seasons 1–20) Guest star list for an animated series  Actor Phil Hartman , who died in 1998, was the most recurring male guest actor on the show, appearing 52 times.  In addition to the show's regular cast of voice actors, celebrity guest stars have been a staple of The Simpsons, an American animated television sitcom created by Matt Groening for the Fox Broadcasting Company, since its first season. The Simpsons focuses on the eponymous family, which consists of Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa and Maggie. The family was initially conceived by Groening for a series of animated shorts, which originally aired as a part of The Tracey Ullman Show between 1987 and 1989. The shorts were developed into a half-hour prime time series which began in December 1989.[1] The series' 29th season began in October 2017 and 660 episodes of The Simpsons have aired. A feature film adaptation of the series called The Simpsons Movie, was released in 2007.  Guest voices have come from a wide range of professions, including actors, athletes, authors, musicians, artists, politicians and scientists. In the show's early years most guest stars voiced original characters, but as the show has continued the number of those appearing as themselves has increased.  The first credited guest star was Marcia Wallace who appeared in """"Bart the Genius"""" in her first stint as Bart's teacher Edna Krabappel. Singer Tony Bennett was the first guest star to appear as himself, appearing briefly in the season two episode """"Dancin' Homer"""". Several guest stars have featured as recurring characters on the show, including Phil Hartman, Joe Mantegna and Kelsey Grammer. Hartman made the most appearances, guest starring 52 times. Grammer, Mantegna, Maurice LaMarche and Frank Welker have appeared twenty times or more; Jon Lovitz has appeared over ten times, while Albert Brooks, Glenn Close, Michael Dees, Dana Gould, Terry W. Greene, Valerie Harper, Jan Hooks, Jane Kaczmarek, Stacy Keach, Kipp Lennon, Jackie Mason, Sally Stevens, George Takei and Michael York have made over five appearances.  Two guest stars, Ricky Gervais and Seth Rogen, earned writing credits for the episodes in which they appeared. Grammer, Mason and three-time guest star Anne Hathaway all won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance for guest voice roles on the show. The show was awarded the Guinness World Record for """"Most Guest Stars Featured in a TV Series"""" in 2010. As of April 28, 2019, there have been 823 guest stars on the show, with this figure rising to 828 if The Simpsons Movie is included.  History [ edit ]  Guest stars have appeared on The Simpsons since its first season, in addition to the show's main cast of Dan Castellaneta, Julie Kavner, Nancy Cartwright, Yeardley Smith, Hank Azaria and Harry Shearer and supporting cast of Tress MacNeille, Pamela Hayden, Maggie Roswell, Russi Taylor, Chris Edgerly and former supporting cast members Marcia Mitzman Gaven, Karl Wiedergott, Doris Grau, Jo Ann Harris, Susan Blu and Christopher Collins.[2] Kevin Michael Richardson started as a recurring guest star in the twenty first season, but joined the supporting cast in the twenty eighth, starting with the episode """"The Last Traction Hero"""". Guest voices have come from a wide range of professions, including actors, athletes, authors, musicians, artists, politicians and scientists. In the earlier seasons, most of the guest stars voiced characters, but eventually more started appearing as themselves. The first male guest star was actor Sam McMurray, who voiced a worker at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant in """"Homer's Odyssey"""", the show's third episode, and Marcia Wallace was the first female guest star on the show starting from Bart the Genius as Edna Krabappel and Ms. Melon. Singer Tony Bennett was the first guest star to appear as himself, appearing in the season two episode """"Dancin' Homer"""" while Aerosmith were the first band with their cameo in the third season's """"Flaming Moe's""""  Several guest stars have made multiple appearances on the show, often as recurring characters. Actress Marcia Wallace guest starred 176 times, making her the most recurring female guest star on the show, until her death in 2013. Edna Krabappel was then retired from the show, but sometimes appears as a ghost, and actor Phil Hartman guest-starred in 52 episodes, more than any other male actor, although his initial role in the second season episode """"Bart Gets Hit By a Car"""" in 1991 was intended to be a one-off.[4] He voiced the recurring characters Troy McClure and Lionel Hutz as well as numerous other one-time characters, until his death in 1998. McClure and Hutz were subsequently retired from the show.[5] Actor Kelsey Grammer first appeared as Sideshow Bob in the first-season episode """"Krusty Gets Busted"""" while actor Joe Mantegna made his first appearance as Fat Tony in the third season episode """"Bart the Murderer"""". The two have appeared in 21 and 28 episodes respectively; Mantegna also appeared in the film. Both roles were originally written for other actors: Bob was originally to be voiced by James Earl Jones,[6] who later guest starred three times on the show, while Fat Tony was written for Sheldon Leonard.[4] Other repeat guest stars include Albert Brooks, Glenn Close, Jan Hooks, Maurice LaMarche, Jon Lovitz, Jane Kaczmarek, Jackie Mason, Charles Napier and Frank Welker.  According to Groening, guest star choices """"come from the writers saying, 'Wouldn't it be cool to have [such a person on the show]?'"""",[7] while showrunner Al Jean has stated the reasoning is """"we want to meet our heroes.""""[8] Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein, showrunners of the seventh and eight seasons, favored guest stars with what they felt were unique and interesting voices such as actors R. Lee Ermey, Donald Sutherland, Kirk Douglas and Lawrence Tierney.[9] In 2014, Jean stated that fewer people would be appearing as themselves, as the staff did not want it to become a """"crazy roster"""".[10]  Many guest stars come into the show's recording studio to record their parts,[7] although some are recorded over the telephone.[11] Two guest stars have been credited with writing the episode in which they guest starred. Comedian Ricky Gervais wrote the episode """"Homer Simpson, This Is Your Wife"""",[12] while actor Seth Rogen co-wrote the episode """"Homer the Whopper"""" with Evan Goldberg.[13] Two guest stars were credited with pseudonyms. Actor Dustin Hoffman was credited as """"Sam Etic"""" for the episode """"Lisa's Substitute"""" while musician Michael Jackson was credited as """"John Jay Smith"""" for the episode """"Stark Raving Dad"""". After the latter episode, the producers decided that if a celebrity wished to guest star on the show, they had to be willing to be credited under their real name.[14]  Numerous people have rejected the chance to appear on the show. Actor William Shatner has been described as the first person to reject the show.[15] The producers have consistently failed to persuade any former President of the United States to appear.[8] Musicians Bruce Springsteen and Bob Dylan have also rejected multiple invitations to guest star on the series.[16][17] Other people to turn the show down include actors Michael Caine,[18] Tom Cruise,[19] Tiff Needell, Archie Norman, Kyle MacLachlan, Natalie Imbruglia, Clint Eastwood and Anthony Hopkins[20] and director Quentin Tarantino.[21] Musician Prince turned down a role in a sequel to """"Stark Raving Dad"""", which meant the script was never produced.[22]  Others have accepted the offer, but have been unable to record a role. Musician Frank Zappa and actor Anthony Perkins both became too ill to record their parts,[20][23] while Jim Carrey had to drop out due to time constraints,[24] and Faye Dunaway cancelled.[25] Christopher Walken originally agreed appear as himself in """"Insane Clown Poppy"""". However, he then decided to demand a lot more money than the producers were willing to pay. Instead, Jay Mohr provided the voice of Walken. In the end credits, Jay Mohr is actually credited with the voice of Christopher Walken, the credit says """"Jay Mohr as Christopher Walken"""". This is the first time this has ever been done.  Robby Krieger of The Doors recorded a cameo for the episode """"The Great Money Caper"""", but his part was cut because the writers felt his appearance seemed too forced. The scene was later included on the season's DVD release.[26] Similarly, actress Catherine O'Hara recorded the voice of Colette the waitress in """"Flaming Moe's"""", but was redubbed with Jo Ann Harris who the producers felt was a better fit.[27] Ron Howard, in what would have been his third appearance on The Simpsons, was advertised as guest starring on """"Children of a Lesser Clod"""".[28] However, he did not appear for any recording sessions.  Mason, Grammer and Anne Hathaway have each won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance for their guest voice roles on the show.[29] The show was awarded the Guinness World Record for """"Most Guest Stars Featured in a TV Series"""" on May 23, 2010, with Guinness estimating that the show has featured """"at least 555 as of series 21"""".[30] As of April 28, 2019, there have been 823 guest stars on the show, totaling 1417 guest spots. These figures rise to 828 and 1425 respectively if The Simpsons Movie is counted as well.  Guest stars [ edit ]  The color of the season number in the first column corresponds to the color of that season's DVD boxset or digital purchase image for the seasons what have not been released in physical format.  In the No. column: The first number refers to the order it aired during the entire series. The second number refers to the episode number within its season: i.e. 1506 would be the sixth episode of the fifteenth season.  The production code refers to the code assigned to the episode by the production team. The first two characters refer to the season the episode was made for. The first season is 7Gxx, the second is 7Fxx, the third is 8Fxx and the fourth is 9Fxx. After that, the fifth season started with 1F and continued in order until season nine (which was 5F). Starting with season ten, the production codes started with AABF, with the first letter changing for each season (i.e. BABF, CABF, etc.). The number at the end of the code is the order in which that episode was produced during that production run.  Guests with """"(archival)"""" after their names refer to cases where roles were not recorded specifically for the episode, but instead archival audio and/or footage from independent sources was used in the episode. In most cases these appearances have been uncredited and are usually not considered as proper guest stars given the circumstances.  Actor Albert Brooks made the first two of his seven appearances in season one.  Singer Tony Bennett was the first person to voice himself on the show.  Theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking has made four appearances on the show as himself.  Ronaldo is the only soccer player to appear on the show.  Actress Kristen Wiig has played two different characters on the show.

The 42-year-old entertainer is currently in a long and acrimonious split from her ex, Stephen Belafonte. Mel filed for divorce in March, after nearly 10 years of marriage.  The following month, the singer got a restraining order against her estranged husband, alleging that Belafonte beat and threatened her throughout their nearly 10-year marriage.  WATCH: Nick Cannon, Simon Cowell, Sharon Osbourne and 'AGT' Stars Support Mel B Amid Divorce Drama  Days later, Belafonte, who denied the allegations, responded when he filed a petition seeking joint custody of their 5-year-old daughter, Madison, and requesting spousal support and that Mel pay his legal fees.

"""Oprah's dad to pen tell-all book Oprah Winfrey's father is writing a book about her. The US chat show host was left gobsmacked after discovering her dad, Vernon, is to pen a tell-all book about her life - without telling her first.  Oprah told the New York Daily News newspaper: """"It made me laugh recently when one of my assistants said, 'The Daily News is calling. They say they heard your father is writing a book about you.'  """"I said, 'That's impossible. I can assure them it's not true.' But then my sister said, 'I think you should call your father.'  """"I called him and it turned out he is writing a book. The worst part of it was him saying, 'I meant to tell you I've been working on it.' """"  Oprah confessed she was """"upset"""" and """"stunned"""" by 74-year-old Vernon's revelation.  She said: """"The last person in the world who should be doing a book about me is Vernon Winfrey.""""  The Emmy award-winning TV star was 14 and pregnant when she left her mother's home to live with Vernon in Nashville.  Her baby tragically died just weeks old, and Oprah has credited her father with inspiring her to continue with her education.  Vernon, who plans to call his book Things Unspoken, has said Oprah was """"out of hand and an unruly child"""".  Oprah said it would have been a """"nice gesture"""" if her dad had told her in advance about the publishing deal, because they """"have a good relationship"""".  Vernon's project is the third book about her Oprah, 53, has been threatened with recently.  Earlier this month, an Illinois court dismissed extortion charges after Keifer Bonvillain requested $1,5-million (about R10-million) from Oprah claiming he had """"embarrassing information"""" destined for a book.  And Kitty Kelley is also working on a biography about the star.  Oprah said: """"I'm not cooperating with it, but if she wants to write a book, fine. This is America.

"""Mel B and Estranged Husband Stephen Belafonte Settle Domestic Violence Claims in Divorce: Report Image zoom Jason LaVeris/FilmMagic  Melanie “Mel B” Brown and husband Stephen Belafonte seem to have settled some of the issues in their contentious divorce ahead of their trial, set to begin Nov. 13.  The couple, who are ending their marriage after 10 years wed, reached an agreement in the domestic violence portion of their divorce, TMZ reports — with the former Spice Girl agreeing to drop the temporary restraining order she filed in April against Belafonte.  Brown, 42, had accused her ex of physically and emotionally abusing her, alleging in her TRO filing that she was “in fear” for her life and that Belafonte’s alleged abuse ramped up when her career was on an upswing.  Belafonte, 42, and Brown — who wed in Las Vegas in June 2007 — also settled a portion of their property division, TMZ reports.  A rep for Brown did not immediately return PEOPLE’s request for comment.  Image zoom Melanie """"Mel B"""" Brown and Stephen Belafonte Phillip Faraone/Getty  The former couple’s divorce has been a nasty battle since Brown filed in March and asked for joint legal and physical custody of their 6-year-old daughter, Madison. Brown also requested to terminate the court’s ability to award spousal support in her filing. (PEOPLE confirmed in July Brown was ordered to pay Belafonte $40,000 per month in temporary spousal support and pay for $140,000 in attorney fees and forensic fees on Belafonte’s behalf.)  Amid her restraining order filings in April, Brown claimed that Belafonte hired a German exchange student, Lorraine Gilles, to be their nanny and pitted the two women against each other. Brown claimed the nanny’s relationship with Belafonte became sexual and that he impregnated her before demanding an abortion.  She was granted a restraining order against Gilles in April, but Gilles in turn sued Brown for defamation, claiming her pregnancy was the result of a one-night stand. Their battle remains unresolved.  RELATED VIDEO: Forced Threesomes and Injury Coverups: The Biggest Bombshell Allegations from Mel B’s Restraining Order Against Her Ex  Meanwhile in October, new details of Brown and Belafonte’s marriage emerged in a court proceeding in Los Angeles, with Brown claiming Belafonte drugged her throughout “much to most” of the relationship, according to his lawyer, Philip Cohen, as reported by multiple outlets.  “Miss Brown now takes the position she was drugged by Mr. Belafonte throughout the course of the marriage,” Cohen said in L.A. Superior Court. Belafonte and his legal team responded to Brown’s allegations, claiming they are “nothing more than a smear campaign.”  Also in court in October, Brown’s lawyers said Belafonte had at least 56 videos, a third of which were “of a sexual nature,” according to The Sun. Susan Wiesner, a member of Brown’s legal team, said “90 percent” of the videos were of the former Spice Girl and were made without Brown’s consent. Belafonte’s lawyers dismissed the claim, arguing that the videos were “consensual.”  Hearings between Brown and Belafonte’s legal teams remain ongoing.""",/home/yanwang_nuist/dev_workspace/prj_python/fnd-bootstrap/dataset/gossip/Images/gossip_test/Fj0NCfAr7yvsf5J2dAJLGUksUsAhPWxy.jpg,1.0

"""Maks Chmerkovskiy Returns to Dancing with the Stars After Skipping Last Week Due to 'Personal Issue' Maksim Chmerkovskiy is back in the building!  On Monday, the Dancing With the Stars pro — who missed last week’s show — put on his dancing shoes to compete with partner Vanessa Lachey in a routine commemorating her most memorable year.  When the celebrity and pro dancer couples were introduced at the top of the show, audiences saw Chmerkovskiy return with Lachey.  Last week, DWTS co-host Erin Andrews informed viewers that Chmerkovskiy’s absence was due to “a personal issue,” but sources told PEOPLE that the DWTS pro, 37, and Lachey, 36, had been “bickering” since the beginning of the competition and that he chose to sit out from rehearsals and the live show due to a clash between their “big personalities.”  But on Wednesday, Chmerkovskiy apologized to Lachey for his absence, which left his partner to perform with first-time pro Alan Bersten.  “As you are all aware, I had to leave the show last week to take care of some personal issues. I take full responsibility for my absence. And want to apologize to my partner Vanessa. We are both looking forward to dancing for our fans next week!” the father of one wrote.  As you are all aware, I had to leave the show last week to take care of some personal issues.

On Monday, Chmerkovskiy’s wife — and fellow DWTS pro — Peta Murgatroyd shared with PEOPLE that even though “a lot was made of the fact that Maks missed last week’s show,” only a “few people know how crazy this show really gets — not only physically on your body but mentally as well.”  “We care about our partners, and that’s what makes it so hard sometime, because you care and love each other, and you want them to do so well. You invest so much time-wise, and you just want them to be the best and get the best results possible at the end of the day on the Monday night. But it is difficult to deal with life, stresses, rehearsals and then show time and everything that goes along with that,” she added.  Image zoom Rob Latour/Variety/REX/Shutterstock  While this isn’t the first time Chmerkovskiy has been rumored to clash with his DWTS counterpart — in 2015 he told The Real that his season 13 partner, soccer star Hope Solo, is “literally the only person that I could dislike from my past, present or future” — an insider insisted that he and Lachey are a unified pair.  FROM COINAGE: The Cost of Dancing With the Stars’ Mirrorball Trophy  “Maks and Vanessa are a team and completely support each other 100 percent,” the insider told PEOPLE. “They are so friendly backstage and are great to work with.

"""Matt Lauer's could pay ex-wife Annette Roque $20M in divorce Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window)  Shamed “Today” host Matt Lauer is “bending over backwards” to give his soon to be ex-wife Annette Roque everything she wants in their divorce — including a multimillion-dollar payout — because he feels so guilty for cheating with multiple women at work, according to friends.  Lauer — who was axed by NBC bosses in November for a string of inappropriate affairs — has already agreed to pay Roque, his wife of nearly 20 years, up to $20 million, Page Six can reveal.  The couple are now getting along amicably, the friends tell us — and are both spending time at their 12-bedroom Hamptons pile, Strongheart Manor, as they prepare to finalize their divorce.  A source says: “Things really have settled down. Matt and Annette are getting on and they’re both spending time with their kids. They hope to settle the divorce very soon.”  Lauer bought the estate from Richard Gere for $36.5 million in 2016 and used it as a bolthole immediately after he was sacked by NBC.  However, the question remains — who will get the estate in the divorce — as they both love it and it’s Lauer’s “dream home.” It is set on a massive 6.3 acres on the peninsula of North Haven near Sag Harbor.  As we revealed last month, the divorce is nearly official — and the process has been smoother because the couple had already signed a “postnup” after Lauer persuaded a furious Roque to drop her divorce filing in 2006.  At the time, Roque cited “mental abuse, extreme mental and emotional distress, humiliation, torment and anxiety,” after learning that Lauer had been unfaithful. But she withdrew the filing months later after signing the postnup.  A source said: “Matt agreed to pay Annette a lump sum of millions back in 2006 as an incentive to stay with him to help him maintain his squeaky clean image as ‘America’s Dad.’  “She also got an allowance every year, plus it was agreed that she would get a share of the value of all their homes if they did split.”  So far, Lauer has offloaded his Upper East Side apartment for more than its $7.35 million asking price.  The former anchor also has one of his Sag Harbor homes on the market for $12.75 million, a significant drop from the original asking price of $18 million. His New Zealand farm, which he purchased for a reported $9.2 million in February 2017, is currently also still in his possession despite the fact he was poised to lose it as part of the country’s “good character” test following his sexual misconduct allegations.  The source added: “Matt’s bending over backwards to give Annette everything she wants because he feels so guilty. But he would love the Hamptons home.”  Lauer and Roque are believed to have agreed to share custody of their three children, Jack, 17, Romy, 14, and Thijs, 11, in the divorce.  While Lauer has spent the past nine months working on his relationship with his kids, and friends say he is a “devoted dad,” he still feels resentment about his sacking.  The source said: “Matt still maintains the relationships he had in the workplace were consensual. He does feel like the poster boy of the #MeToo movement when he sees other high powered men hanging on to their jobs despite allegations.”  A lawyer for Lauer didn’t return calls.""",/home/yanwang_nuist/dev_workspace/prj_python/fnd-bootstrap/dataset/gossip/Images/gossip_test/GDEqxvmjflXMObSYxhKv9flANyznWpEu.jpg,1.0
"""Everything Jennifer Garner Has Said About Ben Affleck Since Their Split It’s been more than three years since Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner announced their decision to separate after 10 years of marriage.  Though the two have not been romantically involved since then, they have remained very much a part of each other’s lives, co-parenting their three children — Violet, 12, Seraphina, 9, and Sam, 6 — together and often attending church and going on vacations as a family.  Then on Wednesday, Garner was spotted driving her ex to a rehab facility.  “Ben’s priorities remain his family and his sobriety,” a source told ET. “He continues to attend meetings and mediation classes for his well-being. You have to work at your sobriety every day and he does that.”  Since their separation in 2015, the exes have not officially divorced. While Garner, 46, has remained fiercely private and protective of her family, she has, on occasion, spoken about Affleck and their children.  Here’s everything she’s said about Affleck since their split:  July 2018  Garner opened up about the pressures of public life on her marriage and her family during a CBS Sunday Morning interview, saying, “Looking back on that, I really feel the stress of it. I really — I could cry talking about it.”  She added, “What I think I’ve learned is that the scrutiny in your private life puts a pressure to make something happen. You feel a pressure to hurry up and get married, ‘cause you think that’ll end the, ‘Are they engaged? Are they not?’ And that’s true in reverse, as well. If you are — if there is any inkling of trouble, or if the tabloids decide there’s trouble, it can create trouble. But to be honest, public scrutiny, everyone says, ‘Oh, you’ve had to go through this in public.’ The public isn’t what’s hard. What’s hard is going through it.”  June 2018  For Father’s Day, Garner penned a rare and touching tribute to Affleck on Instagram, writing, “Our kids are lucky to have a dad who looks at them the way you look at them and loves them the way you love them, @benaffleck. #happyfathersday #threeluckykids #haveagreatday.”  November 2017  In an interview with news.com.au, Garner talked about being separated from the father of her children, saying, “I would not have chosen this life for myself or for my kids. I would not choose to be single or be in this position. It’s something that we are working through.”  May 2017  After People magazine released a cover story about Garner’s new life as a single mom, Garner took to Facebook to set the record straight.  “This isn’t a tragedy by any measure, but it does affect me and my family and so, before my mom’s garden club lights up her phone, I wanted to set the record straight,"""" she said.

"""Revealed: Prince Harry had a crush on Meghan Markle ‘TWO YEARS’ before meeting her In a documentary set to air tomorrow, royal expert Katie Nicholl reveals that the smitten prince described the Suits star as his “ideal girl” two years before they met last year. She said: “He had a crush on Rachel Zane two years before he met Meghan and the reason I know is because I was having drinks with one of his friends. “She told me she’d been on a night out with Prince Harry. He was single at the time, so she said, ‘Harry, who’s your ideal girl?’ And he said ‘Meghan Markle from Suits.’” Prince Harry is said to have organised a meeting with his dream woman after having asked mutual friend Markus Anderson, a close friend of the divorcee, to set up a meeting between the two in order to fulfil his Rachel Zane fantasies.  GETTY The smitten couple struggled to keep their hands off each other during their latest appearance  The meeting reportedly took place when the 36-year-old was in London in July last year to watch Serena Williams play tennis at Wimbledon. According to The Sun, Ms Nicholl's added: “He asked Markus if he could set up, not a date, but an opportunity for them to meet and that happened in one of the private rooms of Soho House. “There were about seven or eight of them altogether and it was a perfect opportunity for Harry and Meghan to come together in a really informal environment and actually talk. “She was funny, feisty, confident and she wasn’t swayed or knocked by the fact that he was Prince Harry.

"""Jennifer Lopez & Alex Rodriguez Aren't Getting Married Anytime Soon, As She Once Again Made Clear — VIDEO Just because two people are in love and are great together doesn't mean the idea of marriage should continuously be forced upon them. For example, once again, Jennifer Lopez has said she's not marrying Alex Rodriguez — at this point in time. The marriage question is one the World of Dance judge is repeatedly asked. It's also an exhausting topic that Lopez should no longer have to discuss during every interview.  During Thursday's The Ellen DeGeneres Show, host Ellen DeGeneres brought up Lopez's relationship with Rodriguez and the possibility of the two saying """"I do."""" DeGeneres began the conversation by telling J. Lo and referring to A-Rod, """"He said that y'all are gonna be getting married.""""  The former Shades of Blue star quickly denied that statement by declaring, """"He did not say that. He did not say that.""""  The two went back and forth a bit in a joking manner about Rodriguez's supposed declaration of marriage. But, that wasn't enough to stop DeGeneres from, once again, asking Lopez, """"So, you'll be getting married?""""  The multifaceted Lopez answered, """"I don't know. I don't know."""" DeGeneres pushed further by stating, """"You should, cuz y'all seem very happy."""" The Second Act star agreed with the latter. """"We are,"""" she said. """"We've been together a couple years, it's nice.""""  TheEllenShow on YouTube  Of course, DeGeneres didn't stop there and said about them having a wedding, """"It would be good to do for Christmas.""""  However, rather than giving a verbal response, Lopez reacted with the most telling facial expression. Here it is:  At this point of the marriage conversation, Lopez was still laughing and going along with DeGeneres, but it also seemed like she didn't know what else to say. It was almost like The Fosters executive producer was ready to move on to something else.  Was DeGeneres mainly teasing? Yes. Is she happy for the duo and wants them to live a beautiful life together? Of course. Does she really care or is trying to force them to get married? No. The interview was all in good fun and one Lopez took extremely well. That said, it has to get old reciting the same thing over and over again about your personal relationship.  Andrew Toth/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images  In a Harper's Bazaar interview published on March 15, Lopez once again said about getting married, """"I do believe in marriage. And I would love to grow old with somebody in a committed relationship. But I’m not forcing anything right now. It’s good, it’s healthy; we communicate well.""""  Then, during a June 11 Good Morning America interview, Lopez said about marrying Rodriguez, """"We have to take our time. I've made plenty of mistakes in my past and ... we're mature now."""" She continued,  """"We're grown ups and we're going to take our time and we're going to do things at our own pace. And our life right now is incredibly wonderful. Between our kids and our work we're truly blessed. We don't need anything more right now.""""  How many more times does she need to say it? They are content with the current status of their relationship. The two certainly aren't in any rush to walk down the aisle. Even if someone's just joking around with Lopez and Rodriguez about marriage, having to repeatedly field those types of questions and to reaffirm their happiness is tiring. Let's all just let them enjoy their relationship without the pressure of marriage.""",/home/yanwang_nuist/dev_workspace/prj_python/fnd-bootstrap/dataset/gossip/Images/gossip_test/BSQnZlJbvTbZkrEJ8IQy2ucotb78dOUl.jpg,0.0

"""David Beckham's Cheating Scandal & Alleged Affair With Rebecca Loos As the couple deny fresh cheating and divorce rumours we take a look back at David's alleged affair with Rebecca Loos.  The world's most famous soccer player marries a superstar pop singer, what could possibly go wrong? Almost ever since David and Victoria Beckham's 1999 nuptials, their relationship has been plagued by tales of alleged affairs, most famously the purported affair between David and his former-assistant, Rebecca Loos. And it seems a new-wave of cheating accusations could hit the Beckhams, as Twitter this weekend was set alight with rumours of infidelity and an impending Beckham divorce. Victoria, 44, and David, 43, have since released a statement denying the new rumours, and branding them """"fake news"""". If you're experiencing déjà vu, it's because David and Victoria have penned similar statements defending their relationship in 2003, when Rebecca Loos famously claimed she had an affair with the soccer champion.  David and Victoria show a united front in the face of fresh cheating rumours.  David's alleged affair with assistant Rebecca Loos  In 2003, David was in the prime of his football career. The England Captain had been sold by his home club Manchester United to Spain's Real Madrid, for a whopping price. And while his star had never been brighter, a shock was soon to hit the Beckham family. In September of that year, David was spotted with a woman at a nightclub in Madrid. The woman was later identified as his assistant Rebecca Loos. Subsequently, the rumour mill kick-started into overdrive, churning out tales that the Beckham marriage was in trouble, which David denied. The now-defunct News Of The World, published a story from """"a source"""" outlining several sexual encounters David and Loos allegedly had after that night at the club. They also reported the two exchanged racy texts. The story claimed Victoria contacted the assistant, warning her to stay away.  Rebecca Loos reportedly had an affair with David Beckham while the pair were working together in Spain.  Rebecca Loos' brother's statement  Loos brother then surprised British tabloids by claiming his sister had confirmed to him that she'd had an affair with David in Spain. """"Rebecca phoned home early this morning. I am overwhelmed with shock,"""" Loos' brother John Charles told the Daily Mail in April 2004. """"Rebecca was upset when she parted company with David and Victoria last year. She became very down and cried a lot. At times she looked heartbroken. I thought it was because of professional reasons. But now I am beginning to understand there must have been more to it.""""  Rebecca Loos, Victoria Beckham and her son Romeo watch David play for Real Madrid back in 2003.  While explosive allegations of David's infidelity flew, Victoria reportedly packed up their two children and flew to Switzerland, where David was to meet them from Madrid. Spokespeople for the family said the trip was a long-planned getaway and not a plan to escape media attention.  David's statement on alleged affair  In response to Loos' brother's comments, David released a statement. """"During the past few months I have become accustomed to reading more and more ludicrous stories about my private life,"""" it read. """"What appeared this morning is just one further example. The simple truth is that I am very happily married. I have a wonderful wife and two very special kids. There is nothing any third party can do to change these facts.""""  Rebecca Loos' tell-all  Rebecca gave an explosive tell-all interview with SKY TV alleging her professional relationship turned romantic with David as he grew lonely in Madrid. """"I think the chemistry between David and I was so strong and people were not happy because I was being very unprofessional and he's a married man,"""" she said at the time. """"He is very generous lover. He gives a lot. He pleases. He knows what you want. It's all about you and not so much about him. It's nice."""" When asked about the Beckham's intention to involved layers, Loos replied, """"What are they consulting their lawyers for? What can they do? I think they have worked very hard at getting the image they have and I think they will do everything they can to maintain it."""" """"So whether that involves having happy shots taken or calling their lawyers it's up to them. I am 100 percent sure of what I am talking about, there no doubt in my mind I have no reason to lie -- why should I? I am just here to tell you my experience. He knows the truth and I know the truth."""" Again, Victoria and David vehemently denied Loos' story calling it """"absurd and unsubstantiated"""". Victoria and her two sons, Brooklyn and Romeo relocated to Spain so the family could be together with David.  The couple have weathered allegations of affairs time and time again.  The Beckham's sue  Following the months and months of stories of alleged infidelities, the soccer player and his wife turned to their lawyers, seeking justice. In 2004, they filed a lawsuit against News of the World, after a story was published claiming David also had an affair with a beautician named Danielle Heath. The couple then amended the complaint in 2005 to include another story by the publisher which detailed quotes from the couple's former-nanny Abbie Gibson, that the Beckham marriage was a lie. They also sued the nanny for breach of confidence. """"We are sick and tired of people trying to make money at the expense of our family,"""" the Beckhams said in a statement.  The ultimate power-couple.  Where is Rebecca Loos now?  Fourteen years after her alleged affair with David Beckham, Rebecca Loos has completely turned her life around After being dismissed from her position at Real Madrid, Loos went on to star on a range of reality TV shows. The Spanish-born beauty eventually fell in love with medical adviser Sven Christjar Skaiaa, who worked on one of the shows she appeared on.""",/home/yanwang_nuist/dev_workspace/prj_python/fnd-bootstrap/dataset/gossip/Images/gossip_test/79TnIzdhkvyXMvmZkUBldbIaoPC6w9fz.jpg,0.0

TMZ has learned.  The former 'Hills' star filed to divorce Corey Bohan on Wednesday, and according to docs the split appears to be triggered by a series of incidents she considers menacing and emotionally abusive.  In the docs, obtained by TMZ, Audrina says the violence began in mid August when they argued about her accusing him of cheating. She says she was holding their daughter, Kirra Max, when Corey pushed her back. Audrina says he then emptied out her backpack and purse, and began punching himself in the head ... and threatening to bash himself in the head with a metal canister if she left.  She says Corey had threatened suicide before -- in July while she was out of town on a business trip.  According to docs, on Sept. 6, Corey was at home watching KIirra, and when Audrina got home, he began calling her names and harassing her. Audrina says she grabbed Kirra and went upstairs, but he followed and told her she's """"f**ked up"""" because of her childhood and her messed up mother. She says she started recording video of him, and he said, """"Grow some balls and pull the trigger and file for divorce.""""  At this point, she says she was terrified and called police to file a report. On Sept. 15, she says child protective services came to the house to meet with her.  Her breaking point came this past weekend. Audrina says she was on a panel at a beauty event, and Corey showed up and followed her on the stage.

Audrina filed for a temporary restraining order against him on Monday, Sept. 18 ... which was granted.  Corey -- an Australian BMX rider -- and Audrina just got married in Hawaii in November 2016.

Check it out, and then come back here!)  It was the ending """"This Is Us"""" fans have been waiting for almost since the series began. No more teases, hints or guesswork — on Sunday night's episode, Jack Pearson died.  And it was absolutely brutal.  Mandy Moore, who plays wife Rebecca to Milo Ventimiglia's Jack, stopped by TODAY Monday morning to commiserate about the loss and to make a confession about how the cast feels now that the major plot point is behind them.  """"I think all of us are tremendously relieved,"""" she explained. """"Because Milo and I, for one, have known since the beginning. ... But it's just nice to sort of pop that bubble a little.""""  Of course, you'd be hard-pressed to find a fan who would describe their own morning-after mood the same way.  Milo Ventimiglia as Jack, Mandy Moore as Rebecca on """"This Is Us."""" NBC  No amount of anticipation could have prepared viewers for the gut-punch of the Pearson family patriarch's final moments, which somehow managed to be completely expected and totally shocking at the same time.  Leading into the special post-Super Bowl installment of the tearjerker drama, Jack's final fate seemed known — surely he died in the house fire a faulty appliance sparked in the previous episode.  Except, that's not quite how it happened.  Instead, Jack heroically cleared his family out of the home and even went back into the blaze to save Kate's dog. Sure, he was covered in soot, suffered a burn and had a cough, but he actually survived the fire.  All he needed to do was go to the hospital to treat his singed arm. But while Rebecca casually popped off for a snack in the waiting area, a doctor came out and revealed that Jack was dead. Just like that. It wasn't the fire that took him — not directly. The smoke he inhaled taxed his system and prompted a catastrophic heart attack.  Yet that shocking twist wasn't even the most difficult part of the tragedy. That distinction goes to Rebecca for her heartbreaking reaction.  She didn't see it coming. She didn't believe the doctor. She had to go see him for herself.  """"Jack? Babe?""""  That's when the nation's supply of tissues took a tumble.  And despite Moore's talk of feeling relief now that it's over, on TODAY, the actress admitted that moment left all the show's stars in tears.  """"Pretty much all of the episodes affect all of us, like, we all cry,"""" she said. But this one not only brought tears, it took away their words. """"We saw the episode together as a cast at Dan Fogelman's house last week, and none of us could speak afterwards. We were sort of speechless.""""  It's not surprising that Jack's death would prompt a moment of silence. After all, viewers are definitely grieving today.  At least they don't have to be sad about waiting for the next episode. The drama returns Tuesday night.  """"Now we can move forward with the show and answer more pressing questions, as well,"""" Moore told us.  More pressing than how Jack died?

""""I was never really taught the definition of feminism when I was a little girl and I wish I had been.""""

"""Inside Melania Trump’s complicated White House life: Separate schedule, different priorities   According to several White House staff members, first lady Melania Trump has erected a de facto wall between the East Wing, where she is renovating her office and enjoying growing popularity, and the West Wing, where her husband works. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)  Donald and Melania Trump’s remarkably separate daily routines begin with him getting up around 5:30 a.m., watching cable news shows and tweeting.  The first lady wakes in her own bedroom a bit later, according to two close friends of the Trumps. She then readies their 12-year-old son for school, including checking to make sure his homework is in his backpack.  Amid the noise and churn of the Trump administration — most recently about how the president paid money to silence Stormy Daniels — Melania Trump has settled into a quieter routine, often apart from the president, raising their son and carving out a place for herself in a most untraditional White House.  The first lady has not directly addressed the affairs that Daniels and another woman, Karen McDougal, said they had with her husband. But she has noticeably begun to raise her profile, independent from the president’s, and she has called a news conference in the White House Rose Garden on Monday, a public appearance that would have been almost unthinkable just a few months ago.  “Her focus all along has been children, and this launch is meant to formalize what her role will be for the next three to seven years,” said Stephanie Grisham, Melania’s spokeswoman. She said the first lady will devote the rest of the Trump presidency to the issues children face today and their well-being.  [Melania Trump plans to bring attention to the problems children face]  In recent weeks, the first lady has been at the center of more high-profile events than during the entire previous year — including attending the funeral of former first lady Barbara Bush solo.  Political marriages tend to be more complicated than most, but it’s striking that the Trumps make so little effort to project a more united front. Although both are keenly aware of the power of visual images, some of their memorable moments together are awkward: Melania swatting his hand away on a tarmac, and several times caught on camera seeming to resist his outreach.  “She is a dignified, private person, and she’ll deal with her personal life in private and it’s no one’s business,” said Stephanie Winston Wolkoff, a longtime friend of Melania’s. “They are not that couple that holds hands just because; she is old-world European and it’s not who she is.”  It is unusual to see a candid shot of the president enjoying an unplanned moment with his wife, or even with Barron, the first young son in the White House since John F. Kennedy Jr. in the early 1960s.  The Trumps are often apart even during their free time, according to several people who know the couple’s schedules. At Mar-a-Lago on holidays and weekends, the president golfs or dines with politicians, business executives and media personalities on the patio, while Melania is often nowhere to be seen. According to several current and former aides, the president and first lady often do not eat together in the White House either.  “They spend very little to no time together,” said one longtime friend of the president.  Grisham said the president and Melania do spend time with each other. “Aside from the president’s solo trips, the family spends most evenings together.” She also played down the headlines about Trump’s alleged affairs and said Melania “is focused on being a mom. She’s focused on being a wife, and she’s focused on her role as first lady. And that’s it. The rest is just noise.”  A senior West Wing official, when asked about the couple’s separate schedules and bedrooms, declined to comment, saying it wasn’t official business.  Melania grants few interviews and declined to speak for this article, but during the campaign she told The Washington Post that she and her husband are “very independent,” adding, “We give ourselves and each other space.”  According to several people who know the couple, that space appears to have grown wider under the White House roof — especially since Daniels, a porn star whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, as well as Karen McDougal, a Playboy model, publicly talked about their alleged affairs with Trump during his marriage to Melania. Daniels was paid $130,000 during the campaign by a Trump attorney to stop talking about the affair.  Last week, Trump tweeted that he repaid the attorney to “stop the false and extortionist accusations made by her about an affair.” Rudolph W. Giuliani, one of Trump’s lawyers, told NBC News that payment was made “to prevent personal embarrassment and heartache to [Trump’s] wife.”  Another awkward exchange happened April 26 with Trump calling into “Fox & Friends,” announcing that it was Melania’s birthday, and then suddenly talking about Daniels. Asked on the same TV show what he had gotten Melania for her birthday, he paused: “Maybe, I didn’t get her so much. I got her a beautiful card, you know I’m very busy to be running out looking for presents.”  According to several White House staff members, Melania has erected a de facto wall between the East Wing, where she is renovating her office and enjoying growing popularity, and the West Wing, where her husband and Ivanka Trump, her eldest stepdaughter, have offices.  While she goes to the West Wing for official duties, she does not walk down the hall, pop her head in and see how the president’s day is going.  “She seldom sets foot in the West Wing,” said one person with firsthand knowledge.  Yet, many political analysts believe that Trump will need Melania at his side if he wants to win again in 2020.  The Trumps have broken the traditional mold of a presidential family from the moment he was sworn in. While Melania stood beside the president at the Capitol, his two ex-wives, Ivana Trump and Marla Maples, sat in the crowd.  Trump is the only president to be married three times. Melania is 48, and the president is 71.  Rather than move into the White House with her husband, Melania stayed in New York for six months to allow Barron to finish his school year there. That delay initially put Melania at a disadvantage, according to a friend who said the rhythm of the White House had already been established, and left her out of the mix. Some staff positions from the first lady’s office were diverted to the West Wing — including to support Ivanka, who is a presidential adviser, according to a person close to the first lady.

She delayed her move to the White House by six months so that he could finish out the school year in New York. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)  Donald Trump and Barron board Air Force One. It is rare to see a candid shot of the president enjoying an unplanned moment with his wife, or even with Barron, the first young son in the White House since John F. Kennedy Jr. in the early 1960s. (Andrew Harnik/AP)  Ivanka, 36, and Melania, both former models, do not have a close relationship and are very different from one another, several people who know them both said. Grisham said it was not only wrong to say Melania was not close to her stepdaughter but “hurtful.”  Noticeably, Melania’s presence is growing as Ivanka’s fades.  Last year, an official White House statement described Ivanka as holding an “unprecedented role for a first daughter” and she has at times taken on the duties of a first lady. Ivanka acts as the president’s policy adviser, has traveled the globe as her father’s surrogate, and sat down with world leaders at the White House. But recently her public profile has been reduced.  First ladies often have had considerable influence, as an informal adviser to the president and the person closest to him. They have been the hidden hand in policy decisions and hiring and firings. And, they can command attention for causes. Most recently, Laura Bush established the National Book Festival and used her foreign trips to focus concern on HIV/AIDS, and Michelle Obama promoted girls’ education globally and started a movement here to get children exercising and eating healthier.  Melania’s staff is unusually small; with 10 people, it is about half the size of Michelle Obama’s at its peak.  Melania has borrowed books from the White House Historical Association to study the first lady’s role and plans to outline on Monday a new initiative concerning children.  Several polls have shown that as she becomes more visible, her popularity is rising. In many ways the image she projects is the least like Trump’s of all the Trumps.  The president organizes big rallies; Melania often holds meetings with just a few people. Her husband rails against family-based “chain migration”; she is from Slovenia and now her parents, also immigrants, have become legal residents here, too.  The president mocks political enemies on Twitter with his derogatory nicknames such as “Cryin’ Charles E. Schumer” or “Cheatin’ Obama”; Melania calls cyberbullying an “evil” and organized a White House conference to try to stop it.  Melania has complained that she doesn’t deserve the mean comments she has read about herself online. She has been heard saying that she knows her husband has contributed to the combative nature of today’s online chatter, and one associate said she has persisted with her anti-cyberbullying efforts despite White House advice that she pick any other issue to champion.    Melania Trump, who has said she plans to focus on issues affecting children during her time as first lady, visited a youth program at Andrews Air Force Base last year. (Melina Mara/The Washington Post)  In March, Melania invited top executives from Twitter, Facebook and other tech companies, along with nonprofits working on Internet safety, to the White House to hold a meeting on the issue.  “I am well aware that people are skeptical of me discussing this topic,” she told the group. “I have been criticized for my commitment to tackling this issue, and I know that will continue. But it will not stop me for doing what I know is right,” she said in opening remarks. “We have to find a better way to talk to each other, to disagree with each other, to respect each other.”  Stephen Balkam, the founder and CEO of the Family Online Safety Institute, was seated at a table with the first lady. “It was a pretty remarkable opening,” he said. “I was pleased that she addressed the elephant in the room.”  Melania has not always been willing to go in a different direction from her husband. In 2011, when Trump was one of the leading """"birthers"""" challenging the validity of President Obama's birth certificate and U.S. citizenship, Melania backed him up.  “What’s this with the birth certificate obsession? Did he ask to see yours when you met him?” asked TV interviewer Joy Behar.  “Do you want to see President Obama’s birth certificate or not?” Melania responded. She also said what Obama had made public to date was “different” from a birth certificate. “It would be very easy if President Obama would just show it,” she said.  “It is not only Donald who wants to see it. It’s the American people . . . they want to see that.”  But as first lady, she has publicly praised Michelle Obama and laughed alongside President Obama, who sat beside her at Barbara Bush’s funeral last month in Houston. She also shared the pew with Bill and Hillary Clinton — two favorite targets of her husband’s criticism.  Melania received a warm reception from the former presidents and first ladies. Photos of them all together — the Obamas, the Clintons, George W. Bush, Laura Bush and George H.W. Bush — show Melania beaming.    Former presidents and former first ladies Laura Bush, George W. Bush, Bill Clinton, Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, Michelle Obama, and first lady Melania Trump pose with former president George H.W. Bush at the funeral of Barbara Bush in Houston.

Phillip/AP)  She has also traveled apart from her husband — even when they are going to the same destination. In February, hours after the New Yorker published a story about Trump’s alleged affair with McDougal, the Playboy model, Melania did not walk with Trump across the White House’s South Lawn to board Marine One.  Both Trumps were heading to Mar-a-Lago for the weekend, but instead of making the very public walk across the White House lawn with her husband to the helicopter, she drove separately to the Maryland military airport to catch Air Force One. Grisham told reporters at the time that given the first lady’s schedule, it was just easier for the couple to meet at the plane. When her motorcade pulled up, White House press aides shouted at journalists to get off the plane until she boarded. No photos were allowed of her arrival.  As first ladies often are, Melania is more popular than her husband. But two friends of the couple say the president, who pays close attention to his poll numbers, also fixates on hers. Her approval rating was 47 percent to his 40 percent in a January CNN poll.  Grisham said Melania takes her role seriously and is careful to coordinate with Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary. “Basically, we’re like, ‘Okay, we’ll put this out,’ or, ‘We’ll wait for you.’ . . . We don’t want to conflict with the president’s message of the day, nor do we want him to do that to us.”  But, she added, “the 24/7 social media-cable news cycle and a West Wing that’s very active . . . perhaps overshadows some of the good work she’s doing.”  Trump described Melania to supporters in a recent email as his “rock and foundation.” “I wouldn’t be the man I am today without her by my side,” he said. “My BEAUTIFUL, kindhearted and exceptional wife.”  “They have an unspoken affinity,” said Winston Wolkoff, whose official advisory arrangement in the first lady’s office ended earlier this year amid headlines about inauguration spending and the White House’s move to end informal contracts.  Another person close to the president said they had heard him call Melania when he travels and “she is someone he relies on and listens to.”    “They are not that couple that holds hands just because; she is old-world European and it’s not who she is. . . . They have an unspoken affinity. They have fun together. He relies on her and he trusts her,” said Stephanie Winston Wolkoff, a longtime friend of Melania’s. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)  Melania has said she sometimes offers advice to her husband — including about his tweets — but that doesn’t mean he takes it.  During one dinner in the White House in late 2017, Melania told the president that he should be more concerned about the investigation led by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III and that his legal team wasn’t protecting him, according to a person who attended the dinner. Trump disagreed, this person said, insisting that the investigation was going to exonerate him and that he had great lawyers. Grisham disputed this account, saying: “Your anonymous sources are wrong.” Since that dinner, two of three lawyers have left Trump’s Russia team.  Several people in the White House, who like others interviewed for this story did not want to be quoted by name discussing the first couple’s relationship, said Melania does not trust some members of her husband’s staff. Two people in a position to know said she particularly disliked former chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon and told her husband so, and she was upset about the abrupt dismissal of John McEntee, Trump’s young personal assistant. He left over a security clearance issue but is now working on Trump’s reelection effort.  Trump insisted on a prenuptial agreement when he married Melania 13 years ago, just as he had with his two previous wives. The terms have never been made public. A person close to Melania noted that the prenuptial was signed before his political career, which forced her to take on a whole new role and one, as a friend said, that is “unpaid.”  """"Free Melania!"""" continues to be a popular meme. Late-night TV comedy skits portray her as trapped inside the White House, unhappy.  For months, a persistent rumor has floated around Washington that Melania doesn’t really live in the White House and stays in a house with her parents and Barron near his suburban Washington school.  “It’s 1,000 percent false. We laugh at it all the time,” Grisham said.  “It’s an urban legend,” said Rickie Niceta Lloyd, the White House social secretary.  Melania is exceedingly close to her parents and her son, Barron, who also speaks Slovenian with his grandparents. When she is out of the public eye, she is often with her family, friends say.  Her office declined to say where her parents live, or even whether they keep a room at the White House, as Michelle Obama’s mother did.  [Melania Trump’s parents are legal permanent residents, raising questions about whether they relied on ‘chain migration’]  Melania does spend a lot of time in the White House, according to people who work there, and has a very good relationship with the permanent household staff of nearly 100 that includes chefs, florists and butlers, and she oversees the residence as well as the state floor.  Friends say she is a perfectionist who oversees the tiniest details of events in which she is involved.  She enjoys putting her personal mark on the historic home and has redesigned the family living quarters. While her husband favors the lavish gold-and-glitz decor of their Trump Tower penthouse, Melania has picked neutral colors.  “It is a very comfortable and calming place to be in,” Winston Wolkoff said.  Still, Trump often waves friends up to the residence after holiday parties or social gatherings and gives tours of the Lincoln Bedroom, where he remarks on how tall the former president was while showing off the Gettysburg Address and other features of the home. Melania has, however, told confidantes she wants to keep the residence private.  Although English is not her first language, she is getting more used to public speaking. She has also begun releasing videos of her work.  The latest highly produced video shows her preparing for the recent state dinner for French President Emmanuel Macron and has been viewed by nearly 1.5 million people.  Twenty-two years after first coming to the United States to model, she is now one of the most-photographed women in the world.  Paolo Zampolli, who helped arrange for Melania to work in the U.S. fashion industry and sees her in the White House, said Melania is blossoming.  “It’s an incredible story. It’s the American Dream,” said Zampolli. “She really will become the queen of people’s hearts, like Princess Diana was. I think the world will be seeing more of her.”""",/home/yanwang_nuist/dev_workspace/prj_python/fnd-bootstrap/dataset/gossip/Images/gossip_test/qbdzfgb5lTeR2W1BECOsTTXY6yKVObE3.jpg,1.0

They were discovered shot to death inside Donerson's home in Chicago, Illinois.[1] The victims were the brother and mother of singer Jennifer Hudson. Jennifer's seven-year-old nephew Julian King, the son of her elder sister Julia Hudson, was initially reported missing and an AMBER Alert was issued; Julian King's body was found on October 27 in Chicago's West Side area, in a parked car matching the AMBER Alert description.[2] Autopsy results indicated that Julian King's death was due to """"multiple gunshot wounds.""""[3] A pistol found in a West Side vacant lot was confirmed as the murder weapon by Chicago police.[4]  Investigation [ edit ]  On the day that the bodies of Hudson's mother and brother were discovered, Chicago police took Julia Hudson's estranged husband William Balfour, 27, into custody but did not file charges against him.[5] Balfour was on parole and spent nearly seven years in prison for attempted murder, vehicular hijacking and possession of a stolen vehicle. The Illinois Department of Corrections' records reveal one of Balfour's addresses to be the home where Donerson and Jason Hudson were murdered.[1]  After the Chicago police had held Balfour for the maximum 48 hours allowable without charging him with a crime, he was held by the Illinois Department of Corrections on a parole violation.[5] At the November 10, 2008 parole hearing, the prisoner review board was told by the Cook County State's Attorney's office that Balfour's current or former girlfriend told investigators she saw Balfour with a gun identical to the murder weapon several days before the murder occurred.[5] Board chairman Jorge Montes said that although Balfour may have violated other conditions of his parole, including failing to get anger management and substance abuse counseling, the gun allegation alone was sufficient to hold Balfour until a December 3 hearing before the full Illinois Prisoner Review Board.[5]  Montes said that the allegations from the woman included that Balfour had admitted to her that he was involved in the murders, but those allegations were not part of the parole review hearing.[6] Balfour appeared at the hearing without an assigned attorney because he had not been charged with a crime.[5]  Arrest and Conviction [ edit ]  On December 1, 2008, Balfour was arrested and charged with three counts of first-degree murder for the deaths of Donerson, Jason Hudson and King, as well as one count of felony home invasion.[7] At a December 3 court hearing in which Balfour was denied bail, a prosecutor alleged that Balfour had committed the murders out of anger that his estranged wife was dating another man.[8] Balfour's attorney Joshua Kutnick said that his client maintained his innocence in the crimes.[7] Balfour was indicted on December 30.[9] On January 20, 2009, he pleaded not guilty to all charges.[10] He was convicted in May, 2012 and sentenced to 3 life sentences plus 120 years.  Legacy [ edit ]  In the aftermath of the deaths, Hudson's family announced the creation of the Hudson-King Foundation for Families of Slain Victims, a foundation """"to care for the needs of families who have lost relatives to a violent crime,"""" according to a statement released to the press.[11]""",/home/yanwang_nuist/dev_workspace/prj_python/fnd-bootstrap/dataset/gossip/Images/gossip_test/NXMvS2rWzEPmUC6DzCltSincQWSkPhw7.jpg,1.0

"""Look What You Made Me Do """"Look What You Made Me Do"""" is a song recorded by American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift, released on August 24, 2017 by Big Machine Records as the lead single from her sixth studio album Reputation (2017). Swift wrote and produced the song with her co-producer Jack Antonoff. """"Look What You Made Me Do"""" is an electroclash and pop song,[2] with lyrics about various issues that built Swift's reputation. Right Said Fred band members Fred Fairbrass, Richard Fairbrass, and Rob Manzoli are also credited as songwriters, as it interpolates the melody of their song """"I'm Too Sexy"""" (1991).  The song broke a string of records, including the record for the most plays in a single day on Spotify. Commercially, """"Look What You Made Me Do"""" has topped the charts in Australia, Canada, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Greece, Ireland, Israel, Japan, Lebanon, Malaysia, New Zealand, the Philippines, Slovakia, the United Kingdom, and the United States. It has also received Platinum certifications in Australia, Canada, Italy, Sweden and the United States. It also received Diamond certification in Brazil. It is known as one of her biggest hits. [3]  The song received a polarized response from music critics. Its music video was directed by Joseph Kahn and upon its release on YouTube, it attained the most views in its first 24 hours of release, more than any other music video on the site at that time.[4] The record was then overtaken by Ariana Grande's """"Thank U, Next"""" in 2018.  Promotion and release [ edit ]  On August 23, 2017, Swift announced that the first single from her upcoming sixth album, titled Reputation, would come out the following night.[5] The song was released to streaming services on August 24,[6] and earned over eight million streams within twenty-four hours of its Spotify release, breaking the record for the highest first-day streaming for a single track.[7] The record was surpassed in 2018 by Drake's """"God's Plan"""".[8] """"Look What You Made Me Do"""" was then released the next day onto iTunes for digital download through Big Machine Records[9] and onto Italian contemporary hit radio[10] before a United Kingdom radio release on August 26, 2017.[11] It impacted American contemporary hit radio three days afterwards.[12] A CD single release followed in Germany on October 27, 2017.[13]  A lyric video heavily based on the Saul Bass imagery used in the film Vertigo was released through Swift's official Vevo account on August 25, 2017.[14] The video was produced by Swift and Joseph Kahn and directed by ODD.[15] It gained more than 19 million views during its first 24 hours on YouTube, surpassing """"Something Just like This"""" by The Chainsmokers and Coldplay as the most viewed lyric video within that time period.[16] As of October 2018, the lyric video on YouTube has amassed over 100 million views.  Composition and lyrical interpretation [ edit ]  """"Look What You Made Me Do"""" runs for 3 minutes and 31 seconds.[9] Music critics have described the track as a hybrid of electroclash and pop,[2] as well as a dance-pop[17] and an electro-pop song.[14] It emphasizes the blame that is placed on an enemy, in particular the line """"I've got a list of names and yours is in red, underlined"""". The middle eight of the song features Swift saying, """"I'm sorry, the old Taylor can't come to the phone right now / Why? / Oh, 'cause she's dead!""""[citation needed] """"Look What You Made Me Do"""" is performed in the key of A minor with a tempo of 128 beats per minute.[18] Swift's vocals span from G 3 to F 5 .[18]Brittany Spanos of Rolling Stone noted a """"nightmarish aesthetic"""" present in the song, and believed it to be a continuation of the """"antagonistic persona"""" from """"Bad Blood"""".[17] Richard Fairbrass, Fred Fairbrass and Rob Manzoli, the members of the British dance-pop group Right Said Fred, are credited as songwriters because the song interpolates the melody of their song """"I'm Too Sexy"""".[19][20] According to Fred Fairbrass, he and his brother were contacted one week before the release of """"Look What You Made Me Do"""" and were asked whether a """"big, contemporary female artist who hasn't released anything for a while"""" – whose identity they were not told – would be able to use a portion of their song for her latest single.[21] Although the brothers agreed to a deal, they did not officially find out that the artist in question was Swift until the morning after the song was released, but had deduced that it was her based on the description they were given.[21] Both of the Fairbrass brothers said that they enjoyed """"Look What You Made Me Do""""; Fred Fairbrass told Rolling Stone, """"I like the cynical aspect of the lyric, because 'I'm Too Sexy' is a cynical song, and I think she channeled that quite well.""""[21] A representative for Swift confirmed that the song interpolated the melody from """"I'm Too Sexy"""", but did not include sampled audio from the earlier song.[22]  Critical reception [ edit ]  """"Look What You Made Me Do"""" received polarized reviews from critics, with some calling it a fierce return, and some a disappointment.[23][24][25] USA Today said that the polarizing reaction to the song illustrated Swift's position as a """"ubiquitous cultural force"""".[26] The Telegraph Randy Lewis praised the song, deeming Swift and Antonoff's work as """"blowing past the production clichés of clap tracks and hiccuped syllabic hooks that have proliferated across Top 40 fare in recent years with boldly inventive textures and fresh melodic, rhythmic and sonic accents"""". He also added how the track musically and sonically shifted alongside the lyrics.[27] Sarah Carson of the Los Angeles Times wrote a positive review of the song, saying: """"The reverberating crescendo builds and ever more delicious is the wickedness of Swift's menacing protagonist"""", praising Swift for her successful embrace of the villain character the media has portrayed her as previous to the song's release.[28] Variety's Chris Willman also praised Swift's embrace of a darker-styled pop music and the stylistic conflict between the song's pre-chorus and chorus.[29] Mark Harris, in New York magazine's pop culture blog, thought of Swift's song as a pop art anthem for the Trump era in how she reappropriates her public feuds as empowering badges of honor without acknowledging her own responsibility or blame.[30]  However, the single received more criticism than her previous lead singles. Maura Johnston of The Guardian wrote a negative review of the song, faulting the """"sloppy"""" lyrics and blaming Swift for not giving a clear context in the lyrics.[14] Lindsay Zolad of The Ringer said """"Unleashed on a deeply confused public late Thursday night, the song is a strange collage of retro reference points: mid-aughts Gossip Girl placement pop, the soundtrack to Disney's live-action Maleficent, and — yes, really — Right Said Fred's I'm Too Sexy, except devoid of the self-effacing humor and wit. Yes, the new Taylor Swift song just made me compliment Right Said Fred."""" Brittany Spanos of Rolling Stone believed that the song marked a continuation of the feud between Swift and rapper Kanye West; the latter had previously name-dropped Swift in his song """"Famous"""" by using the line, """"I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex / Why? / I made that bitch famous"""". The single was noted as being a darker, angrier work than what Swift had done before.[17][31] Hugh McIntye of Forbes was critical of the change in style, saying that it """"didn't sound like [Swift]"""" and that it """"may have some kinks to work out"""".[2] Meaghan Garvey from Pitchfork referred to it in a review as """"a hardcore self-own"""" track.[32]  Chart performance [ edit ]  In the United States, """"Look What You Made Me Do"""" debuted at number seventy-seven on the Billboard Hot 100, powered by its first three days of airplay.[33] It also sold slightly under 200,000 digital copies within its first day of sales in the country, where it became the fastest selling download since Ed Sheeran's """"Shape of You"""".[34] One week later, the song ascended from No. 77 to No. 1 on the Hot 100 after its first full week of tracking, becoming the fifth largest rise to the top position and Swift's fifth number-one single in the United States. It ended the 16-week reign of """"Despacito"""". It also topped the nation's Streaming Songs chart with 84.4 million streams, becoming its most streamed song within a week by a female artist and second overall behind the 103 million that Baauer's """"Harlem Shake"""" gained in 2013. The track also had more weekly streams in the US than any other song in 2017. The song stayed atop the charts for three consecutive weeks, tying with American rapper Cardi B's """"Bodak Yellow"""" as the longest running female at the number one spot on the charts in 2017. With 353,000 copies sold in its first week, """"Look What You Made Me Do"""" opened atop the US Digital Songs chart and had the country's biggest sales opening since Justin Timberlake's """"Can't Stop the Feeling!"""" in 2016 as well as the best weekly sales for a song by a female artist since Adele's """"Hello"""" in 2015. The track also became the country's first number-one song with a female artist since Halsey was featured on """"Closer"""" by The Chainsmokers and the first song with a female lead artist since Sia's """"Cheap Thrills"""" with Sean Paul (both in 2016). It additionally was the first solo song by a female to top the US charts since Adele's """"Hello"""".[35] It remained atop the Hot 100 and Streaming Songs charts for a second week with 114,000 copies sold and 61.2 million streams, though descended to number two on the Digital Songs chart when another Reputation track titled """"...Ready for It?"""" debuted at number one with 135,000 digital copies sold and opened at number four on the Hot 100. As a result, Swift became the first artist to have two tracks sell over 100,000 digital copies in the nation within a week since Sheeran with """"Shape of You"""" and """"Castle on the Hill"""". It also became the first time a female had two songs within the top five of the Hot 100 since 2015 when Swift's previous tracks """"Blank Space"""" and """"Shake It Off"""" respectively were at numbers four and five on the chart.[36] The single also topped the Mainstream Top 40 chart, becoming Swift's eighth single to do so.[37] However, a week after reaching number one on the Mainstream Top 40, it moved to number 7, being the largest fall from the top in the chart's history; and from number 5 to number 20 on the all-format Radio Songs chart, the biggest drop from the top five in that chart's 27-year history.[38]  In the United Kingdom, """"Look What You Made Me Do"""" sold 20,000 copies and was streamed 2.4 million times in less than a week.[39] The song debuted at the top the UK Singles Chart on September 1, 2017 – for the week ending date September 7, 2017 – with opening sales of 30,000 copies and 5.3 million streams within the week and becoming Swift's first chart-topping song in Britain.[40] After two weeks at the top spot, it was displaced by Sam Smith's """"Too Good at Goodbyes"""".[41]  """"Look What You Made Me Do"""" also debuted at number one in the Republic of Ireland on September 1, 2017 and became Swift's first song to top the Irish Singles Chart. In doing so, it surpassed the number three peaks of her singles """"Love Story"""" (in 2009) and """"Shake It Off"""" (in 2014).  """"Look What You Made Me Do"""" opened at number one in Australia on September 2, 2017, becoming her fifth track to top the ARIA Charts.[42] It spent another week at the nation's summit[43] before """"Too Good at Goodbyes"""" took the top position there as well.[44] The song has been certified Platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) for shipments of 70,000 units.[45] After debuting at number one on the Canadian Hot 100,[46] """"Look What You Made Me Do"""" was also certified Platinum by Music Canada for shipments of 80,000 units on September 14, 2017.[47]  In New Zealand, """"Look What You Made Me Do"""" entered at the number one spot on September 1, 2017, becoming Swift's fourth chart-topping single there.  In the Philippines, """"Look What You Made Me Do"""" debuted at number 7 spot on the Philippine Hot 100 on its first week. A week later, it soared to the number 1 spot, ending the 10-week reign of """"Despacito"""" by Luis Fonsi & Daddy Yankee featuring Justin Bieber. It descended to the runner-up position the following week, as the latter song reclaimed the top spot for an 11th week.  Music video [ edit ]  Production and release [ edit ]  Preparation for the music video began in January 2017, while the shooting took place in May.[48][49] The dance was choreographed by Tyce Diorio, who had worked with Swift on """"Shake It Off"""" before.[48] Swift's make-up as a zombie was done by Bill Corso.[49] Post-production of the video lasted until the morning of its release.[49] A 20-second music video teaser was released on Good Morning America on August 25.[50]  The song's music video premiered on August 27, 2017 at the 2017 MTV Video Music Awards.[51] The video broke the record for most-watched video within 24 hours by achieving 43.2 million views on YouTube in its first day. This record was surpassed by Korean group BTS with their music video for """"Idol"""" in August 2018.[52] It topped the 27.7 million Vevo views Adele's """"Hello"""" attracted in that timeframe (only to be surpassed by Ariana Grande's """"Thank U, Next""""), as well as the 36 million YouTube views of Psy's """"Gentleman"""" video.[53][54][55] It was viewed at an average 30,000 times per minute in its first 24 hours, with views reaching over 3 million views per hour.[52] As of January 2019, it has over 1.0 billion views, making it the 90th most-viewed Vevo video of all time and has reached 8.1 million likes on YouTube, making it the 27th most-liked YouTube video of all time.  It was also reported that the diamonds used in a scene were authentic. The diamonds, loaned from celebrity jeweler Neil Lane, were said to be worth over $10 million, hence triggering tight security measures.[56] The video was named the fifth best music video by Rolling Stone and the sixth best music video by Billboard.[citation needed]  Synopsis [ edit ]  The bathtub scene in the music video. The diamonds used were authentic and worth over $10 million.  Swift has said that part of the premise of the video is rooted in the idea that, """"If everything you write about me was true, this is how ridiculous it would look.""""[57] It is a satirical send-up of media theories about her true intentions that have little validity. The video begins with a zombie Swift crawling out of a grave, where the headstone reads """"Here Lies Taylor Swift's reputation"""", and digging another grave for her Met Gala 2014 self. The next scene shows Swift in a bathtub filled with diamonds. She is then seen seated on a throne while snakes surround her and serve tea. Swift later crashes her golden Bugatti Veyron on a post and sings the song's chorus holding a Grammy as the paparazzi take photos. She is also seen swinging inside a cage, robbing a streaming company in a cat mask, and leading a motorcycle gang. Afterwards, she gathers a group of women at """"Squad U"""" and dances with a group of men in another room. At the video's climax, Swift is seen standing in a T-shaped throne while clones of herself (from her past music videos), struggle and fight against each other trying to reach her. As the video concludes, the clones bicker with one another, describing each other as """"so fake"""" and """"playing the victim"""" while one clone of Swift in the background watches in silence. The video ends with a 2009 VMA Swift saying """"I would very much like to be excluded from this narrative"""" and the other Swifts yelling at her to """"shut up!"""" in unison.[58][59]  Analysis [ edit ]  The video contains numerous hidden meanings and references. In the opening scene, there is a subtle """"Nils Sjöberg"""" tombstone shown when Swift is digging up a grave, referencing the pseudonym she used for a songwriting credit on Calvin Harris' 2016 single """"This Is What You Came For"""".[60] Similarly, Swift—masked as a cadaveric version of herself in the """"Out of the Woods"""" music video—was shown digging a grave for herself in a 2014 Met Gala gown, an event that characterized her first public appearance with short hair.[citation needed] A single dollar bill in the bathtub full of diamonds that she bathes in was also speculated to symbolize the dollar she was awarded for winning a sexual assault trial earlier in 2017.[60] Interpretations for the bathtub scene were contrasting. Some believe that it is a response to media statements teasing that she """"cries in a marble bathtub surrounded by pearls.""""[61] Others speculate that the bathtub scene is a jibe at Kim Kardashian, wife of Swift's long-time feuding partner, Kanye West. Some viewers took the scene as a reference to Kardashian's 2016 robbery, in which she was robbed jewelry worth over $10 million while held at gunpoint at a hotel in Paris, France.[62][63] Others argued the claim was unfounded, as Kardashian was not in a bathtub during the robbery.[citation needed]  In a separate scene, Swift is shown sitting atop a golden throne, where a carving of a phrase """"Et tu, Brute?"""" could be seen on the armrest, a reference to Shakespeare's drama Julius Caesar.[60] Swift's infamous title as a """"snake"""" during her hiatus[64] was also represented when a snake slithers onto the throne to serve Swift some tea. When Swift's car crashes, some speculated that it may be a jab at Katy Perry, as Swift's hairdo is similar to Perry's in the scene and the car crash resembles one in Perry's music video for """"Unconditionally"""" (2013). The sports car is also reminiscent of a car in Perry's """"Waking Up in Vegas"""" (2009) video, which Kahn also directed. However, given the theme of making fun of the media, it is likely making fun of the media theory that Swift's real fall-out with Perry was simply for publicity and album material. Swift is mocking the idea that she would damage her friendships for the sake of her business, with the car crash being a metaphor for the fall out between her and Perry and her holding the Grammy Award after the crash within sight of the photographers' cameras referring to the song inspired by their feud winning awards, which the media claimed was Swift's ulterior motive. Swift's withdrawal of her entire music catalog from streaming services and the media theory that she was truly doing this to start her own streaming company were hinted when Swift and her crew robbed a streaming company in the video.[65][66]  Swift gathering at """"Squad U"""" was also said to be a reply to the media dubbing her close """"squad"""" friends as artificial.[60] During the second chorus, Swift can be seen with eight men, each of which revealed an """"I Heart TS"""" crop top after unbuttoning a jacket on her commands. This scene is mocking the idea that Swift forced her then-boyfriend Tom Hiddleston to wear an """"I Heart TS"""" tank top when they were a couple. Swift was also seen standing on a pile of clones of herself from the past, reiterating the idea that she is leaving her past self behind and mocking the idea that she was not genuine during these phases of her life. The shirt that her """"You Belong with Me"""" clone wears is slightly different from the one in the original music video, with her close friends' names scribbled on it this time.[65][66]  In June 2016, discussing the relationship between her and Kanye West after West's song """"Famous"""" (2016) was released, Swift wrote on Instagram, """"I would very much like to be excluded from this narrative.""""[67] The same line is spoken by the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards Taylor clone at the end of the video.[68][69] She is wearing the same outfit Swift had worn during the actual 2009 MTV Video Music Awards, when West interrupted her award-winning speech for Best Female Video.[70]  Live performances [ edit ]  Swift performed """"Look What You Made Me Do"""" live for the first time as part of the KIIS-FM's Jingle Ball 2017 on December 1, 2017 in Inglewood, California.[71] Two days later, Swift returned onstage to perform the song again as part of 99.7 Now!'s Poptopia in San Jose, California with the same setlist.[72] The next week Swift sang the song on three other occasions; the B96 Chicago and Pepsi Jingle Bash 2017 in Chicago, the Z100 Jingle Ball 2017 in New York City and Jingle Bell Ball 2017 in London.[73][74][75]  The song is also a regular part of her setlist for the Reputation Stadium Tour, with a tilted throne and golden snakes; while there are snakes on the high screen in the back during the part, """"I don't trust nobody and nobody trust me, I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams"""", a big cobra floating appears on stage with the line from the bridge announcing the death of the """"Old Taylor"""" spoken by comedian Tiffany Haddish.[76][77]  Accolades [ edit ]  Usage in media [ edit ]  ABC used the song in a promotional video for its Shonda Rhimes' Thursday line-up an hour after its release.[89] Sister network ESPN used it in its college football telecast advertisements for the season opening game between Alabama and Florida State, which was aired on ABC on September 2 along with her other song """"...Ready for It?"""".[90] In the South Park episode """"Moss Piglets"""", the water-bears in Timmy and Jimmy's experiment for the science fair dance to the song in response to Swift's singing. The song was used in the trailer for the 2019 film Murder Mystery.[91]  Track listings [ edit ]  Digital download No. Title Length 1.

""""There is evil among us,"""" she said.  The counselor to the president also slammed officials who, in the wake of the latest historic mass shooting, were calling for action on gun legislation.  “It's so beyond any type of reasonable response that anyone should have — why people see politics immediately,"""" she said, hitting liberal politicians and celebrities for """"taking to Twitter in the comfort of their very luxurious lives and pointing fingers.""""

"""Aquaman offers first look at Nicole Kidman's Atlanna and villainous Black Manta Good news, DC Comics fans. The first look at Aquaman super-villain Black Manta is a pretty faithful adaptation of the comics.  The upcoming blockbuster, which Warner Bros bosses are already promising will set the DCEU back on the right path, has unveiled three new images ahead of the film's launch later this year.  The first of which is The Greatest Showman and The Handmaid's Tale actor Yahya Abdul-Mateen II as David Kane, a bounty and treasure hunter who uses the alias Black Manta.  Director James Wan describes the live-action version of Black Manta as """"part mercenary but full-time pirate"""", which is a pretty spot-on description of the comics version of the character.  Wan also clarifies that although Black Manta has a key role to play in Aquaman, the key conflict will be between Arthur Curry (Jason Momoa) and his brother Orm (Patrick Wilson).  """"Black Manta is a really interesting character who is somehow factored into this story but our main story is about Jason and Patrick,"""" he teased.  EW also premiered alternate covers for its upcoming issue that include the first glimpse of Nicole Kidman as Atlanna, the former Queen of Atlantis and mother of Aquaman's bride Mera (Amber Heard), before sharing three stills from the film too.  In this magazine profile, James Wan teases that his underwater world will include a gritty recreation of the infamous Super Friends scene of Aquaman riding a seahorse, juxtaposed with cannibal trench-dwellers, sea dragons and a giant octopus.  """"The water world my movie takes place in is so separate and so far apart from previous DC movies it's like I'm making my own sci-fi fantasy film,"""" Wan said.

"""Here Are All The Things Caitlyn Jenner Says About Kris Jenner In Her Book In Caitlyn Jenner's new memoir, The Secrets Of My Life, she covers everything from childhood, to college, to the Olympics, to her three marriages and children. There's even a part dedicated to how she feels about Robert Kardashian. (More on that later.)  But let's be honest — we want the Kris juice. Did she know? What did she know? What is she really like?  Here is a breakdown of all the Kris information we gathered from the book.  A breakdown:  First and foremost, Kris was savvy enough to trademark the name """"momager"""" early on. She owns it and she makes money off it. Now that's just genius.  Who set them up?  Baseball player Steve Garvey and his first wife Candace thought Candace's newly-divorced friend Kris Kardashian would be """"perfect"""" for Bruce.  """"The wheels click in my mind: She has four children. I have four children. That's eight kids. Kris has the same amount of baggage that I do,"""" Caitlyn writes.  The two first meet face-to-face at the Riviera Country Club, a golf course in the Pacific Palisades. When Bruce first spots Kris, she is in a white pantsuit. She is in a white pantsuit. Of course she is. She means business. She's Kris Kardashian. Kris also dragged along her nanny to the golf tournament, a weird move that Caitlyn still hasn't figured out to this day since the kids weren't there.  Anyway, then-Bruce makes small talk about sports at the event with the guys, while Kris floats around air kissing and making future plans with every woman at the event and Bruce eyeballs her in action.  """"Who is this person?"""" Caitlyn remembers thinking.  Afterward, the two hit dinner together at Ivy at the Shore in Santa Monica (Kris' choice), where Bruce polishes off a plate of meatloaf and mashed potatoes and Kris doesn't eat but instead expertly applies lipliner to her lips without using a mirror, right there at the table. This is significant at the time to a confused Bruce, who, A. is secretly jealous of her makeup application skills, and B. still finds it a turn-on even though he is feeling like a woman inside. (At this point he has just stopped hormone treatments.)  """"Right before we leave Kris applies pencil outliner on her lips,"""" Caitlyn writes. """"She doesn't even use a mirror. She just goes zip zip zip. It's perfect. Now, I actually know something about using pencil outliner, and it's very hard to do without a mirror (although I'm proud to say I have mastered it.) Now I'm hooked.""""  The two start dating, says Caitlyn, and grow very serious very quickly. In addition to her blind liplining skills, Kris' business acumen soon becomes very clear. Early on the two have dinner with a big Hollywood producer.  """"Every time he mentions someone, Kris says she not only knows her or him but also the entire family, without trying to show off in the least,"""" says Caitlyn. """"Finally flumoxed, the producer turns to her in the middle of dinner and says: Who are you?""""  Caitlyn says Kris says something so uncharacteristic of her today that you'd have to be there to believe it, which Bruce was.  """"I'm just a mom in Beverly Hills,"""" she writes of Kris' reply. Not for long.  Caitlyn goes on to describe the way Kris naturally deals with people and """"takes charge without them even knowing it.""""  Kris """"sends flowers or some other gift after every meeting.""""  She has """"a combination of charm and professional intelligence.""""  She's """"attentive and thoughtful,"""" """"natural and disarming about it all.""""  Caitlyn says at this point in her life as Bruce, Kris """"saved my life,"""" the same way sports had as a child.  """"Love is at the crux of us. But I believe, and this is my opinion and my opinion only, we both want something from each other. I know I do.""""  After they marry, Kris restores Bruce's credibility, gets him back on the speech circuit, and creates genius infomercials starring the two of them to sell exercise equipment with the former Olympian's name attached.

"""Orlando Bloom Orlando Bloom is a popular British actor and heartthrob known for his roles in 'The Lord of the Rings' and 'Pirates of the Caribbean' films.  Who Is Orlando Bloom? Born on January 13, 1977, in Canterbury, England, Orlando Bloom studied acting as a child before he was cast as the heroic Legolas in Peter Jackson's film adaptation of The Lord of the Rings trilogy. Bloom also found major success starring in three films of the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise with Johnny Depp. He's landed other roles in big-screen fare, including Troy, Elizabethtown and The Three Musketeers. Orlando Bloom (Photo: WireImage) ADVERTISEMENT Thanks for watching! Visit Website  Movies  'The Lord of the Rings' Days before his graduation, Bloom was cast in Peter Jackson's adaptation of J.R.R. Tolkien's fantasy trilogy, The Lord of the Rings. The first film of the trilogy, 2001's The Fellowship of the Ring, was a huge blockbuster and critical success. Bloom went on to perform in the two Ring follow-ups; he plays Legolas Greenleaf, a long-haired immortal elf who balances refinement and wisdom with sharp archery and camaraderie, throughout the popular film series. ADVERTISEMENT Thanks for watching! Visit Website ADVERTISEMENT Thanks for watching! Visit Website 'The Pirates of the Caribbean' Franchise After garnering a noted role in Black Hawk Down (2001), another big part was on the horizon for Bloom. In 2003 he starred as the sensitive Will Turner in the Disney action/adventure The Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl, alongside Keira Knightley and Johnny Depp. Pirates marked another huge world blockbuster for Bloom, who would go on to star in the next two sequels of the franchise: Dead's Man Chest (2006) and At World's End (2007).  'Troy,' 'Elizabethtown' Bloom continued doing period work, playing Paris in the 2004 film Troy, which also stars Brad Pitt and Eric Bana. The following year, the actor was featured as a leading man in two films: Ridley Scott's Crusades epic Kingdom of Heaven and Cameron Crowe's drama Elizabethtown (both released in 2005). Then, in 2006, Bloom appeared with actress Zoe Saldana in the thriller Haven, which he also co-produced. In between his more high-profile Hollywood work, Bloom has starred in indie fare like Ned Kelley (2003) and New York, I Love You (2009). Additionally, in 2007, he returned to the stage for a London revival of In Celebration. 'The Three Musketeers,' 'The Hobbit' Another cape-and-sword opportunity arose for Bloom when he was cast in a 2011 update of The Three Musketeers, which failed to catch hold at the U.S. box office. The actor then returned to working with Jackson, reprising his role as Greenleaf for portions of The Hobbit film trilogy, the first installment of which was released in December 2012: The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey. Bloom reprised his role as Will Turner for a fifth time in Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales (2017) and showed his sense of humor in the Andy Samberg-led mockumentary Tour de Pharmacy, playing the character Juju Pepe. In 2018 he starred in the British-Chinese thriller action flick S.M.A.R.T.

"""Who Will Be Meghan Markle's Maid of Honor? Back in 2011, Kate Middleton's sister, Pippa, became the world's most famous maid of honor when she attended to the Duchess of Cambridge during her wedding to Prince William. Although British weddings don't traditionally have maids of honor (instead, there's a """"chief bridesmaid""""), Kate broke custom to have her sibling by her side on her big day.    So who will be Meghan Markle's Pippa on May 19? No one, actually.  Markle will not have a maid of honor at the wedding, since she could not pick one from her close group of friends. (This contradicts reports from January, which said the bride-to-be had already chosen a maid of honor.) This marks a rare The bridesmaids and page boys will all be children (including Prince George and Princess Charlotte), following British royal wedding tradition.  Though they won't be in the bridal party, Meghan's friends have still been supporting her in preparing for the royal wedding on May 19. Below are all the women we thought were in the running for the maid of honor role.  Kate Middleton  Getty Images  The Duchess of Cambridge has been giving Markle helpful advice, on everything from getting adjusted to the royal family to personal style. Despite their budding friendship, it was expected early on that Meghan would choose """"one of her closest friends who has stood by her for many years before meeting Harry,"""" as a maid of honor.  Markle and Middleton only met in January 2017, The Sun reports. And though fans are excited to tout the pair as BFFs, they still have a lot of bonding to go. Royal expert Katie Nicholl told InStyle that Meghan is independent and interested in creating her own friend group in London, but not with any disrespect to Kate at all.  Plus, on a technical level, Kate """"is the future queen consort when William becomes king after his father, and would unlikely be an attending person to another royal bride,"""" royal expert Marlene Koenig revealed. Middleton wasn't even a maid of honor at her own sister's wedding, so it's not a surprise she isn't one at Meghan's.  Jessica Mulroney  Getty Images  Meghan met her best friend and stylist, Jessica Mulroney, in 2011, around the time Markle moved to Toronto (Mulroney's home base) to film Suits, according to The Sun. Since then they've bonded over yoga sessions and joint vacations.  Jessica and her husband, Ben Mulroney (son of former Canadian Prime Minister, Brian Mulroney), helped Meghan and Harry keep undercover after their romance first broke news. She also accompanied Meghan at the Invictus Games closing ceremony, hosted by Prince Harry, which took place in Toronto.  Meghan’s mother, Doria Ragland, Meghan, Jessica, and their friend Markus Anderson at the Invictus Games closing ceremony. Getty Images  Now that the couple is preparing for the wedding, Mulroney continues to offer a hand. She reportedly helped Markle choose her wedding dress designer and is also making a custom piece for the big day.  Priyanka Chopra  The Quantico actress and the Suits star first met at the ELLE Women in Television dinner in 2016. """"We bonded as actors,"""" she told People of their friendship. """"We just became friends, like two girls would.""""  Since Meghan and Harry's relationship went public, Chopra has urged people to consider Markle as more than just the prince's girlfriend. She called Vanity Fair's profile of the actress """"just a little sexist"""" because it mainly focused on Markle's relationship with Harry, and she shut down Wendy Williams when she described Markle as """"Prince Harry's girlfriend.""""  When Harper's BAZAAR Arabia asked her if she's going to be a bridesmaid at the royal wedding, Chopra teased, """"If you see me there, you’ll know.""""  Serena Williams  Getty Images  The star athlete first met Markle in 2014, at DIRECTV's Celebrity Beach Bowl, E! News reports. Meghan recalled in her former lifestyle site, The Tig, """"We hit it off immediately, taking pictures, laughing through the flag football game we were both playing in, and chatting not about tennis or acting, but about all the good old fashioned girly stuff. So began our friendship.""""  In the following years, Markle supported Williams through her matches at competitions like the U.S. Open and Wimbledon (where she actually sat a few rows away from Pippa Middleton). Williams even contributed to a few blog posts to The Tig, according to E!.  """"She quickly became a confidante I would text when I was traveling, the friend I would rally around for her tennis matches, and the down to earth chick I was able to grab lunch with just a couple weeks ago in Toronto,"""" E! says Markle wrote on The Tig, describing her friendship with Williams.  """"We are both the same age, have a penchant for hot sauces, and adore fashion, but what connects us more than those things is perhaps our belief in exceeding expectations–our endless ambition,"""" she added.  Though Meghan unfortunately wasn't present at Williams' nuptials to Reddit founder Alexis Ohanian in November 2017, there's still a chance the newlywed tennis champ could show up at Windsor Castle for Markle.  Sarah Rafferty or Gina Torres  Rafferty, Markle, and Torres promoting Suits Season 4 Getty Images  Markle's fellow Suits actresses may also be helping her ahead of the wedding. In August 2016, the bride-to-be posted an Instagram (which has now been deleted, like the rest of her social media accounts) dedicated to her costars, with the caption: """"Celebrating our friendship of six years and counting. So much deep love for these two women."""" The former actress also nicknamed Rafferty her """"Suits sister wife.""""  After Harry and Meghan's relationship was confirmed in November 2016, Rafferty gave a brief response in an interview with the AP. """"I don't comment on my castmates' personal lives, but of course, it's very exciting,"""" she said. """"And I'm very happy for her.""""  In February 2017, tabloid site OK Magazine reported that Torres and her husband Laurence Fishburne (whom she divorced in November) had a double date with Markle and Harry.  Whether or not Rafferty and Torres are in the bridal party, we can probably expect them to be at the ceremony, since the cast of Suits has reportedly nabbed royal wedding invitations. Plus, it would be a sweet reunion for the former costars, since Meghan's final Suits episode officially aired on April 25.""",/home/yanwang_nuist/dev_workspace/prj_python/fnd-bootstrap/dataset/gossip/Images/gossip_test/XXkPYpmyOrobvJk0iCg0htof9c5TVWNP.jpg,1.0
"""Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop Issues a Rare Response to a Critic Gwyneth Paltrow has faced her share of critics since launching her lifestyle brand Goop in 2008. With almost 10 years of Web site experience under her belt (and decades more as a Hollywood actress), Paltrow typically seems unbothered by her opponents, who have lambasted her for everything from publishing outrageous gift guides to using pseudo-science to promote products. That is until ob-gyn Jen Gunter, a longtime critic of the lifestyle Web site, published a blog post in January about Goop selling its much-discussed $66 vaginal jade eggs, writing, “The only thing your post got right is to check with your doctor before using one. So let me give you some free advice, don’t use vaginal jade eggs.” In a rare move, Goop responded, on Thursday, with Paltrow tweeting out a link to the statement, along with Michelle Obama’s famed Democratic convention quote, “When they go low, we go high,” which, it should be noted, was not in reference to vaginas.  “As goop has grown, so has the attention we receive. We consistently find ourselves to be of interest to many—and for that, we are grateful—but we also find that there are third parties who critique goop to leverage that interest and bring attention to themselves,” the post began before turning its focus to Gunter, who was referred to as a “San Francisco-based ob-gyn/blogger,” who, Goop claimed, “has been taking advantage of the attention and issuing attacks to build her personal platform—ridiculing the women who might read our site in the process.”  Goop’s blog ended with letters from two doctors, Steven Gundry and Aviva Romm. Gundry opened his letter criticizing Gunter’s language (“I have never seen a medical discussion start or end with the ‘F-bomb,’ yet yours did”) before proceeding to list off his résumé, making sure to add that he has never “dropped” an “F-bomb” while speaking with a “discussant.”  Gunter spoke to Buzzfeed about Goop’s statement while on vacation in England, telling the outlet she “was shocked to see Gundry mansplaining science to me. I have four board certifications. I was a doctor when I was 23.” She also questioned why she was the one to be singled out by Goop and Paltrow, as there are many Goop-critics to choose from, including Stephen Colbert and Timothy Caulfield, who wrote an article for Salon in 2015 called “Gwyneth Paltrow Is Wrong About Everything” and recently published a book with a slightly less-declarative title, “Is Gwyneth Paltrow Wrong About Everything?: When Celebrity Culture and Science Clash.” Caulfield also spoke to Buzzfeed about Gunter’s work, saying, “We need more and more voices like Jen to combat the noise on pop culture around health, which is often dominated by science-free celebrities.”  It’s difficult to pinpoint exactly why Jen Gunter was the one to face the unusual ire of Goop and the Goop-adjacent. It could be because, unlike Colbert or even Caulfield, Gunter, as an unknown target, was easier to lash out at. Or maybe she was Goop's most-prolific critic who finally managed to push one button too many. Or Goop was just really tired of all those F-bombs. Whatever the reason and regardless of scientific facts, history has taught us that the world of Goop will keep on spinning.""",/home/yanwang_nuist/dev_workspace/prj_python/fnd-bootstrap/dataset/gossip/Images/gossip_test/Xy73CijIIoaCtyqpgSRG6xHpBBX9MSWx.jpg,1.0
"""Thomas Markle on Prince Harry, politics, and missing daughter Meghan's royal wedding LONDON -- The father of the former Meghan Markle says he talked politics with Prince Harry over the phone -- and Harry said he should give President Donald Trump a chance. Thomas Markle told broadcaster ITV on Monday that he had several phone conversations with Harry, including one in which the prince asked for permission to marry his daughter.  Markle said Mr. Trump was discussed at least once: """"Our conversation was I was complaining about not liking Donald Trump, he said 'give Donald Trump a chance'. I sort of disagreed with that.""""  Markle said he also asked his future son-in-law about Britain's 2016 decision to leave the European Union and got the impression Harry is comfortable with Brexit.  """"I think he was open to the experiment,"""" Markle said.  Newlyweds Prince Harry, Meghan make first public appearance since wedding  Harry's press office declined to comment on Markle's televised interview, which could raise eyebrows because senior royal figures are scrupulously careful not to comment publicly on domestic or international political affairs.  Markle, who had been scheduled to walk his daughter down the aisle, missed the royal wedding in May due to heart problems. He told ITV he was """"doing much better"""" and that he regretted missing the big event.

"""Caitlyn Jenner joins 'girlfriend' Sophia Hutchins at Kylie's birthday Caitlyn Jenner stepped out alongside her close pal and rumoured 'girlfriend' Sophia Hutchins to celebrate her daughter Kylie's 21st birthday in West Hollywood on Thursday.  The Kardashian-Jenner clan headed to hotspot Craig's to mark the mother-of-one's milestone birthday, with Caitlyn choosing to bring along Sophia, 22, for the festivities.  The Keeping Up With The Kardashians star, 68, made sure she was dressed for the occasion and slipped into a sequinned mini dress and suede court heels, while toting the same Gucci handbag as her ex Kris Jenner.  Glamorous: Caitlyn Jenner, 68, was dressed for the occasion as she stepped out to celebrate daughter Kylie Jenner's 21st birthday at Craig's in West Hollywood on Thursday night  Her glittering ensemble nipped in at the waist, drawing attention to Caitlyn's curvaceous frame, and the former athletics star ensured her beauty look matched up to her stand-out outfit.  She wore her caramel-hued locks down in loose curls, parted in the middle, and completed her look with stunning make-up that boasted a dramatic eye and nude lip.  Caitlyn was seen arriving to the popular eatery with Sophia in tow, with the blonde beauty turning heads in a thigh-skimming mini dress that sheathed her slender frame.  BFF: She was joined by her very close pal Sophia Hutchins, 22, who Caitlyn has admitted she is 'inseparable' from  Glittering: The Keeping Up With The Kardashians star slipped into a sequinned dress and suede court heels for the occasion and toted a Gucci handbag  Sophia elongated her honed pins in a pair of studded black strappy heels and, like Caitlyn, she too styled her tresses into perfect curls that sat just past her shoulders.  Her appearance alongside Kylie's father comes after Caitlyn continued to fuel speculation the pair are 'dating' by refusing to address rumours she and Sophia are romantically linked in a new interview with Variety.  Caitlyn addressed her relationship with Sophia, self-confessing the duo are 'inseparable', but wouldn't comment when asked if the pair were romantically involved.  'We are not going to get into that,' the Olympic champion said in response. Although, Caitlyn did add: 'But we are very close. We do a lot of things together.'  Festivities: Sophia caught the eye in a gold mini dress and studded barely-there heels at the lavish bash  Leggy: Sophia made sure to draw attention to her honed pins in her mini dress as she clutched onto a Gucci handbag in one hand  Beauty: She wore her blonde locks down in loose curls, like Caitlyn, and sported a flawless make-up look  Marking the moment: Caitlyn was dressed to impress as she prepared to reunite with ex Kris Jenner and their brood  Keeping coy: Caitlyn's appearance with Sophia comes after she continued to fuel speculation the pair are 'dating' by refusing to address such rumours in a new interview with Variety  'We're inseparable,' she claimed. 'We're the best of friends.'  The former husband of Keeping Up With The Kardashians momager Kris Jenner famously underwent gender reassignment surgery in January 2017 after previously revealing her plans to transition from Bruce to Caitlyn in 2015.  Sophia transitioned while a student at Pepperdine University in Malibu and cited Caitlyn as her role model.  Just last month, the pair attended the ESPY Awards together and in June she opted to attend a charity ball in Vienna, Austria, with Sophia instead of attending her son Brody's wedding.  Caitlyn has grown closer to Sophia amid the distance that's widened between her amid rifts with some of her children and Kardashian step children.

Caitlyn appeared to acknowledge the distance from her family that includes children from three marriages and now grandchildren.  She admitted to Variety that she is closer to some of her offspring than others.  As for her ex-wife Kris, with whom she shares her daughters Kendall and Kylie, 'We haven’t talked in a long time,' she said.  Caitlyn and Kris, however, will have been reunited while celebrating Kylie's birthday. The night proved to be a lavish affair with Kris and the Kardashian-Jenner sisters all in attendance.

"""Lindsey Vonn can’t score a date DESPERATELY alone, dateless and wondering why everybody can find love except you?  No, this isn’t a casting call for Married At First Sight, it’s more of a public service announcement to ease your pain.  You might be eating ice cream straight from the tub while watching Love Actually for the 13th time on a Friday night but don’t despair — you’ve got more in common with an Olympic gold medallist than you might think.  We can’t confirm skiing legend Lindsey Vonn’s Friday night habits involve the above activities, but one thing we know for sure is the glamorous American can’t score herself a date.  It’s pretty remarkable considering what she brings to the table. The 33-year-old is attractive, articulate, famous and an Olympic icon.  Perhaps that’s too intimidating a task for single guys to tackle right now.  A post shared by L I N D S E Y • V O N N (@lindseyvonn) on May 28, 2017 at 8:46am PDT  Fresh from winning bronze in the ladies’ downhill at the recently completed Winter Games in PyeongChang, Vonn was the toast of America. She won gold in the same event at the Vancouver Winter Olympics in 2010 and Bronze in the Super-G program.  That she was able to medal in what was her final Olympic campaign was a seriously impressive effort — but not impressive enough to win her a boyfriend.  Vonn’s list of ex-partners includes golf star Tiger Woods and NFL assistant coach Kenan Smith (they broke up in November), while she was also married to fellow skier Thomas Vonn for four years.  But she’s going through a dry spell.  Vonn was vocal about her desire to find a man in South Korea, hoping Twitter would get the job done.  So apparently it’s Valentine’s Day....I forgot all about it because I’m at the #Olympics and I’m single. Anyone else out there single and want to be my valentine? 🤷🏼‍♀️ #worthashot — lindsey vonn (@lindseyvonn) February 14, 2018  It didn’t, and neither did appearing on the red carpet at this week’s Oscars.  Vonn attended Hollywood’s night of nights with her sister Karin but while some actors left with a little gold statue, she left without even a phone number.  A despondent Vonn revealed not even the after-parties provided her with any luck.  “I didn’t (meet anyone),” Vonn told US show Access Live. “They were all either married or dating or not available.  “I haven’t really had any offers. I didn’t have one guy talk to me that wasn’t married or taken at the entire night, all the after parties, not one guy at the Oscars.”  And so started a segment where hosts Natalie Morales and Kit Hoover went through celebrities to find who would be the best fit for Vonn. They couldn’t believe no man would want her so made it their mission to find Vonn a partner.  Vonn said Mad Men star Jon Hamm was “doable, in the mix” and, unsurprisingly, gave two thumbs up to Brad Pitt.  “Yeah, sure, you guys want to facilitate that? Why not, let’s go. Brad’s everyone’s type,” she said.  Rapper Drake wasn’t really up her alley though. “He’s good looking. I’ve met him a few times, but he’s dated a few people that I know. I’m not sure. He can make a rap song about me and I’m totally fine with that,” Vonn said.  If Drake was a soft no, Vonn rejected New England Patriots NFL star Rob Gronkowski by shouting it from the rooftops.  “I love Gronk, but that is never going to happen,” she said. “I can say never! It’s never going to happen.”  Funnyman Chris Pratt sounded like he was in with a shot, even though Vonn let out an ominous “oohh” when his name came up. It sounded like a match with Pratt would make Vonn’s sister Karin happier than her, because she believes the skier needs more “funny” in her life.  “Oohh. I like Pratt, I like Chris. He’s very funny. Karin says I need more funny in my life,” Vonn said. “I have not (met Pratt). I went to his premiere of Jurassic World but he was married at the time.”  We said at the start this had nothing to do with Married At First Sight, but if you watched Vonn’s appearance on Access Live, you could be forgiven for thinking the talk show had turned into a reality dating program.  Think cult favourite If You Are The One only the available partners aren’t there to have their say. Instead, they appear on a screen and the hosts do the matchmaking for them.  If you don’t know what that show is, then chances are you’re not alone on the couch at 11pm eating those tubs of ice cream while watching late night SBS.  Of all the contenders, Vonn was most enthusiastic about Black Panther star Michael B. Jordan. The pair share the same stylist, and Vonn is hoping to use him to set up a first date.  “He’s very cute,” Vonn said. “My stylist — he’s trying to facilitate (dinner). I’m trying to get the ball rolling on this one, but it hasn’t happened and he’s already shooting his next movie.”  Beautiful and talented but bang out of luck — that’s not really how many people would think the world works for someone like Vonn.  It prompted a revelation you’d never expect to hear from someone with her profile. “I don’t know if I can compete (with other women),” she said.  But don’t worry. There’s no chance of Vonn giving up on love, locking herself at home and becoming a crazy cat lady. After all, she’s got dogs.  “I’ve got three dogs,” she said. “Who needs a guy when you’ve got three dogs?”""",/home/yanwang_nuist/dev_workspace/prj_python/fnd-bootstrap/dataset/gossip/Images/gossip_test/DWV8d7180ORWe7LAwJv9WzKjYtfNeVTq.jpg,1.0
"""What's going on with John Cena and Nikki Bella? A timeline The storybook romance of WWE stars John Cena and Nikki Bella fell apart just weeks before the couple expected to get married, but both parties are now hopeful they can get back together following Cena’s shocking confession on national television.  What’s going on with John Cena and Nikki Bella, and will they reconcile their differences? We went back to 2012 and charted the course of their relationship, and the couple has been divided over two big issues for years.  2012 – The first date  After working together for years, John Cena surprised Nikki Bella by asking her out in 2012, months after filing for divorce from his first wife.  Via Cosmopolitan:  “The first opening line was, ‘Hey, do you want to go to dinner with me?’ and I was kind of like, ‘What? With me?'” Bella said. “It just kind of started out like a dinner date and I have to admit we were friends for so many years, but then when you make it romantic, I couldn’t even say a word to him.”  Late 2013 – Nikki Bella moves in with John Cena after signing a 75-page agreement  As was documented on Total Divas, Nikki Bella moved into Cena’s home in Tampa, Florida, but only after she signed a 75-page contract Cena drew up to protect himself.  We learned more about the contract in an episode of Total Bellas in 2016. Reflecting on his failed first marriage, Cena revealed on the second episode of Total Bellas that Nikki Bella had to sign a 75-page contract before she was able to move in with him.  “Having been through that process, here is how I view it. It is like buying a handgun for home defense. It gives you a sense of security, and it gives you a failsafe in case something happens. And those who buy a handgun for self defense pray, pray they never have to use it. Without it, it’s a dog fight. I had to have your sister sign an agreement to live in the house. And that’s – it wasn’t a one-page, it’s a 75-page agreement.”  (We should note here that John Cena and Nikki Bella have put their relationship on display on reality television for years, and it’s up to you whether you want to believe the scenes are genuine or not.)  May 18th, 2014 – Nikki Bella reveals her hidden first marriage  Nikki Bella married a high school sweetheart at the age of 20, and the couple got divorced when she was 23. She hid the marriage from her entire family, and did not tell Cena. Nikki Bella eventually spilled the beans on an episode of Total Divas.  “When the focus of most of our problems has to do with that one subject,” Cena said, “maybe I should know that stuff.”  September 7th, 2014 – The Time Bomb: John predicts the future  In a Total Divas clip that’s almost eerie to watch in 2018, John Cena foresees the future as he and Nikki Bella discuss the prospect of marriage and becoming parents.  Cena: “Let’s just say I was to ask you to marry me, and we get married. Would that be enough?” Bella: “I don’t know, it’s something you just can’t answer. It’s like saying ‘hey, do you want to be a mother or not? And answer right now, in two seconds.’ You can’t just say that to a woman.” Cena: “I’m trying to be a realist. I’ve told you that I don’t want to get married and I don’t want to have kids, and you do want to get married and you do want to have kids. So I feel like this is a time-bomb over my head.” Bella: “Well jeez, if you feel like you have a time bomb over your head, are you sure you’re happy?” Cena: “I’m extremely happy, I love you to death. But I don’t know where the line is? I feel like someday you’re just going to wake up and be like ‘this is not what I want.'”  September 29th, 2015 – Cena says the thought of having kids gives him ‘the sweats’  Via EOnline:  In an exclusive clip from Sunday’s season finale of Total Divas, it’s no surprise he gets extremely anxious when Nikki Bella brings up babies at the dinner table. “Why don’t we talk about how pregnant all my friends are?” she asks him.  “Because that makes me get the sweats,” he responds. “It seems like I get a different sonogram photo every week. I don’t know where all these kids are coming from.”  Late 2015/Early 2016 – Dolph Ziggler offers ‘marriage, babies’ to Nikki Bella  In a shocking development, Nikki Bella revealed that WWE star Dolph Ziggler, who dated prior to Bella’s relationship with Cena, wants to marry her.  “Dolph pulled me aside at work and told me that he wants to give me marriage and babies. And then he tried to kiss me.”  Ziggler had approached Bella back in 2015 to tell her that he still had feelings for her. Prior to WrestleMania 33, The Miz roasted Cena – who “stole his girlfriend from Dolph Ziggler” – on an episode of Talking Smack.  April 21st, 2016 – Cena confirms he’s still opposed to marriage and to having children in a Rolling Stone profile  Rolling Stone profiled Cena just after WrestleMania 32, and he went public with some very strong views on marriage and having kids.  Via Rolling Stone:  “Just because everyone else is happy with children doesn’t mean that’s how I have to live,” Cena said. “I’ve been upfront about this. I just have things I need to get done. It’s not negotiable. We’ve been to therapy over it. I don’t think it will ever be over with. I’m stubborn as [expletive] and extremely selfish as well. I don’t want kids, I don’t want marriage. That’s me just saying, ‘Hey, this is my life and this is how I’m going to live.”  October 5th, 2016 – The Total Bellas premiere  Cena came off as an extremely rigid creature of habit when television cameras entered his home. Here’s a personal favorite moment from the first show, when Cena is explaining the house rules to Daniel Bryan and Brie Bella.  “After formal dinner the ladies will retreat to the drawing room together. The men will go to the cigar room. Every morning we will have coffee together. We will have an evening fire outside.”  April 2nd, 2017 – The proposal  John Cena and Nikki Bella teamed up for a feud with The Miz and Maryse that culminated at WrestleMania 33 in Orlando. After winning a mixed tag match, Cena dropped down to one knee and proposed in the middle of the ring in front of more than 70,000 people.  March 29th, 2018 – Cena says he wishes he popped the question sooner  In an appearance on NBC’s TODAY, Cena opened up on how he’s changed since the start of his relationship, and said that if he could do it over, he’d ask Nikki Bella to marry him years ago.  “Now when I look at what I had done then as to what I would do now, I just wish I had asked her to marry me then. I guess I wasn’t [ready], but I was ready for her to live in the space I call mine and share everything and do all that…. That didn’t start out like that. I was very abrasive and stern and she had to sign this huge, crazy agreement to come in the front door. So since then I’ve kind of softened.”  April 6th, 2018 – Cena talks wedding plans  In an interview with People, Cena called himself the “final checkpoint.”  Via People:  “I want it yesterday, but we have a date” The former Dancing With the Stars contestant, 34, has been taking the lead when it comes to wedding planning. “All that information rests on her shoulders,” Cena says. “I’m involved in every single step of the process, but I am like the last checkpoint. So, let’s say, décor will be chosen. And then I’ll be given three options but be nudged to like number two. I will politely agree to number two, but I am very much actively a part of the process.”  April 15th, 2018 – The breakup  On a Sunday night, Nikki Bella tweeted out a short statement, announcing that she and Cena had split as a couple and called off their engagement just before their wedding.  We love you all ❤️ N pic.twitter.com/ooACLFXeMv — Nikki & Brie (@BellaTwins) April 16, 2018  April 19th, 2018 – Brie Bella squashes report that Nikki wants to “kill” Cena  Brie Bella, Nikki Bella’s sister, responded to a People.com report on Instagram. In the story, a source claimed that “Brie wants to kill him.” Brie Bella refuted the report, and said that Cena will “always be family.”  “I’d never say this and I’ll always love John Cena like a brother. He’ll always be family. My heart is hurting for he and my sister.”  May 6th, 2018 – Total Bellas teaser shows the moment John and Nikki called it off  It seems like the breakup was caught on camera and will be aired later in the season.  Cena: “I would never force you not to be a mom.” Bella: “I thought I could really sacrifice that, and I just can’t.” Cena: “I’m not sure we should go through with this.”  May 8th, 2018 – Nikki Bella thanks fans, reveals she’s moved in with Brie and Daniel Bryan  “I’ve just kind of been hiding out, but I wanted to reach out to you all and just thank you all for all your love and support. I can’t tell you how much it’s meant to me, especially through a really difficult time.”  May 14th, 2018 – Cena announces he still wants to marry Nikki Bella on TODAY  In a guest host appearance on NBC’s TODAY Show, Cena made his feelings clear, and said he’s willing to have children.  “For anyone out there speculating on what I am doing with my life now, I still love Nicole, I still would love to marry Nicole, I still would love to have a family with Nicole. There was an unfortunate set of circumstances where our relationship ended. There has been a lot of speculation recently about me being seen in public and everybody is thinking like, ‘Oh, John Cena is enjoying the single life.’ No, I was supposed to be married and having honeymoon over these two weeks. …. “So I’m willing to go back on all of these things that I say, and a lot of them I would hang onto just out of stubbornness. ‘I won’t have kids,’ and it took a very strong look in the mirror for me to be like, ‘Why? This is person is my number one and it’s something that’s very valuable to her. Of course we can do this, and I think it would be wonderful.'”  May 14th – Nikki Bella says there is “hope” for the couple  After Cena went public with his intentions, Nikki Bella responded while at at event later in the day.  Via People:  “John is such an amazing man. He really is the love of my life. I truly hope one day that we can work it out and get back together,” admitted Bella. “I think there is hope.”  May 15th, 2018 – Total Bellas promos document the downfall of the relationship  Nikki: “What’s hard at times, what people don’t realize about my relationship is I’m alone a lot… To be honest, since we’ve gotten engaged, John and I have probably shared our bed together maybe 30 days total out of six months? Or 40 days? So hearing Brie and Lauren, J.J. and Bryan all talk about their family stuff and their kids just makes it sink in a little bit more of how lonely it will be and how lonely it gets.”  In another clip, Brie Bella confronts her sister over making too many sacrifices for Cena.  Brie: “Some times you just tiptoe around John to not make him angry, and I think that’s [expletive].” Nikki: “Isn’t that what wives are supposed to do?” Brie: “[Expletive] no. I tell Bryan exactly how I feel all the time. I don’t hold back, ever.”  May 16th, 2018 – Nikki Bella opens up on ‘sacrifice’  Nikki Bella appeared on NBC’s TODAY days after Cena’s confession and explained what contributed to the breakup.  Nikki Bella: “I think, a lot of us that go through the wedding planning process, I think we kind of have to face and get forced to face all these issues that we have hiding deep down inside. I just know that a healthy me will be a healthy us. I do have hope for our future, but I know right now I have to work on me. And before I do say those vows and walk down that aisle, I just don’t want to be hesitant. I don’t want to be regretful.” Kathie Lee Gifford: “So you think you were just getting married too soon before you had those conversations that you needed to have, to have that peace of mind walking forward?” Nikki Bella: “Correct. I think when you sacrifice for so long, it’s like you can give so much and then you get tired of giving. And then someone wants to give it back and you already feel exhausted.”  May 17th, 2018 – Nikki Bella addresses speculation that the breakup is a publicity stunt  “I think sometimes people don’t realize how you could affect them. It’s kind of like when we try to talk to cyberbullies and tell them ‘you have no idea how you’re affecting people.’ I’m a human being. I’m a human being that literally went through a breakup. Everyone’s been through a breakup, and think of how we feel. Mine has been blown up, and then people all started telling me I’m faking it, so you’re now saying that my heartache is fake and that makes it even harder. It’s just like… what can I do right?”  May 30th, 2018 – Total Bellas reveals that the couple had initially called off the wedding in January  A teaser for an upcoming episode of Total Bellas, showing footage that was shot in January, revealed that Nikki Bella had called off the wedding months before the couple had publicly split, leading to a short separation. Cena and Bella reunited at the Raw 25 special later that month.  May 31, 2018 – John and Nikki are reportedly back together  According to Us Weekly, the couple has reunited at last.  July 30th, 2018 – John and Nikki have parted ways  Nikki told People that the relationship is over.""",/home/yanwang_nuist/dev_workspace/prj_python/fnd-bootstrap/dataset/gossip/Images/gossip_test/R0OxCsH0OpcIofAMo68WfbirZmlTTZFQ.jpg,0.0

On Saturday, Cyrus and Hemsworth were spotted hanging out backstage at the Falls Music Festival in Byron Bay.  “They were in a large group with Chris Hemsworth and other family,” says onlooker Ashleigh Saunders. “They were chatting and laughing. At one point, Liam was rubbing Miley’s back. They looked very happy and affectionate.”  Adds another source: “He was really protective of her. He would just pull her close to him and put his arm around her.”  Before the festival, Cyrus also stopped by fashion store Spell to pick out a few items.  “Elsa [Pataky] organized a private session after hours for Miley and a few friends to come and shop,” says Mel Carrero, a publicist for Spell. “She saw a few of Elsa’s pieces and so she wanted to check it out. She was pretty down-to-earth, funny. It was fun.”  After splitting two years ago, “Miley never got over Liam,” a source close to the singer tells PEOPLE. “Despite them constantly fighting before the split, Miley always said Liam is the love of her life.”""",/home/yanwang_nuist/dev_workspace/prj_python/fnd-bootstrap/dataset/gossip/Images/gossip_test/2YgDkAdczDunXM6Yrbmm67T2pL06dIN0.jpg,0.0

"""Jamie Foxx Spotted Visiting Katie Holmes in N.Y.C. Amid a Romantic Summer Image zoom Foxx and Holmes Splash News  Jamie Foxx and Katie Holmes‘ fun summer continued as he was spotted visiting the actress in New York City on Tuesday.  Foxx, 50, wore ripped jeans and a black t-shirt while carrying two bags. Holmes, 39, opted for a red shirt, casual jeans, and sandals. Both wore shades.  The two were seen separately leaving a location in the city. A source explained to PEOPLE in May why Foxx and Holmes tend to leave places at different times.  “Katie and Jamie are still careful about being photographed together,” the source said. “Everyone knows they are dating, but they still want to keep it private.”  RELATED: How Jamie Foxx Helped Save Singer Tank’s Career: ‘He’ll Give You the Shirt Off His Back’  The source said that getting spotted by photographers in Malibu in 2017 made them more cautious. “After the beach pictures, they only spent time together at home and got extra careful,” the source commented. “But this year, they have been more social together. They often go to restaurants for dinner dates, or to hang out with friends.”  RELATED VIDEO: Katie Holmes Steps Out in NYC After Speaking Out Against Online Gossip Site Report  Foxx and Holmes packed on the PDA at the beach earlier this month.

Since then, Douglas has developed quite the following, now touting 54,000 Instagram followers — sealing the deal for her as the next It Girl.  In the cover feature, Carys and her Oscar-winning mother discuss a number of topics, from their move from Bermuda to Manhattan, to her unique sense of style, which mom Zeta-Jones describes as “modern but age appropriate.”  See Jennifer Lopez’s Hottest Fashion Moments  But the up-and-coming teenager isn’t the only member of her family causing a stir, her mom has still got it.

"""Here's Why You Won't See Ashton Kutcher's Kids Online We've heard a lot about Wyatt and Dimitri Kutcher—like how Wyatt had a poop explosion all over dad, or how Dimitri is his parents' biggest fan. But we've never actually seen the daughter and son of Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis. On a recent podcast, Kutcher explained why.  “My wife and I have chosen a career where we're in the public light, but my kids have not,” Ashton told Arianna Huffington on The Thrive Global Podcast. “I think they should have the right to choose that and I actually don't think that they should have images of them as children that are out there, that somebody could potentially blackmail them with. It's their private life; it's not mine to give away.”  He did almost give it away at the beginning. Shortly after Wyatt's birth in 2014, he shared several photos of different babies, refusing to identify which one was his daughter.  """"Mila and I would like to welcome Wyatt Isabelle Kutcher to the world. May your life be filled with wonder, love, laughter, health, happiness, curiosity, and privacy,"""" he wrote in the post. """"Can you guess which one is ours, or does it really matter? All babies are cute.""""  Kutcher and Kunis aren't alone in their decision to shield their children from the public eye. Dax Shepard and Kristen Bell are also known for keeping their kids off social media. And outside of the celebrity circuit, plenty of parents choose to keep their Facebook feeds child-free. And like Kutcher, they explain it's more about their child's autonomy than safety concerns.

"""Chris Pratt's rising fame to blame for Anna Faris split Chris Pratt, 38, and Anna Faris, 40, shocked the world when they announced their separation on Monday.  And sources are now claiming that Chris' movie star status and skyrocketing fame might have contributed to the demise of the couple's eight-year marriage.  'Chris became this huge movie star and Anna wasn't getting any big jobs. She was the more famous and sexy one at the start of their relationship and then things took a turn,' a source told Us Weekly.  Scroll down for video  Competitive? Sources claim Chris Pratt and Anna Faris' shocking split might have been caused by Chris' movie star status and skyrocketing fame  When the couple first started dating in 2009, Chris was just starting his stint on NBC's Parks and Recreation and had virtually no star power.  Anna, on the other hand, was starting to bonafide comedic actress with leading roles in House Bunny, Take Me Home Tonight and What's Your Number.  Friends say the situation has since reversed itself and Chris has gone on to become a major A-list star, while Anna has had a hard time finding big jobs.  The source added that the pair have always been a little competitive with each other.  Jealous? Friends say the work situation has reversed itself and Chris has gone on to become a major A-list star, while Anna has had a hard time finding big jobs  'When they're in a big group, they each want to be the one telling the funniest joke,' the source told the magazine.  Ironically, Anna blamed her last divorce on the same issue.  The actress was married to actor Ben Indra, but got divorced in 2007 and blamed her career successes.  'That kind of destroyed my marriage,' she told Marie Claire in a 2011 cover story. 'The divide became too great.'  It's over: Chris and Anna reportedly split due to the actor's hectic work schedule  Anna and Chris announced their separation on Sunday evening following eight years of marriage, with other sources telling TMZ that their different family values were to blame.  A source told the site that Anna wanted to have more children, but Chris 'can't juggle a growing family with his career', which sees him shoot movies all over the world, leaving home for months at a time.  The couple share four-year-old son Jack, and were keen to stress in their split statement that they 'love him very much'.  The website reports that as well as Chris not wanting to have more children in the foreseeable future there are 'other personal reasons for the split, but the way they see family in the long-term was a big factor in their decision.'  Stuck in the middle: Following the shock announcement Jennifer Lawrence found herself in the middle of reports, as fans accused her of accusing the split  MailOnline have contacted Chris and Anna's representatives for comment.  Following the shock announcement Jennifer Lawrence also found herself in the middle of reports.  As the couple confirmed their separation, fans flocked to social media to bizarrely blame the actress, 26 - who starred in Passengers with Chris in 2016 - for the split.  Taking to Twitter, one wrote: 'I can't believe Chris Pratt and Anna Faris are splitting up this is all Jennifer Lawrence's fault.'  Proud parents: The couple share four-year-old son Jack, and were keen to stress in their split statement that they 'love him very much'  Despite there being no suggestion Jennifer had any involvement in the split, another wrote: 'Jennifer Lawrence broke up Chris Pratt's marriage lol.'  'Watch chris pratt and jennifer lawrence be a thing,' another Twitter user speculated.  Other fans were quick to recall the seemingly awkward exchange that Anna and Jennifer shared when embracing at the premiere of Passengers in December 2016.  Though the ladies hugged it out in front of photographers, Anna appeared to have a pained expression while Lawrence kept her hands claw-like instead of fully touching her co-star's wife.  Co-stars: Jennifer and Chris starred together in the 2016 sci-fi flick Passengers  Awkward? Fans were quick to recall the seemingly awkward exchange that Faris, 40, and Lawrence shared when embracing at the premiere of Passengers in December 2016  Rumors swirled in 2016 that Chris and Jennifer had hooked up while filming their sci-fi disappointment Passengers.  Though the claims were strongly denied by all parties involved, Anna opened up about how the rumors affected her in an interview in December 2016.  'It made me feel incredibly insecure,' she told Isla Fisher on her own podcast, Anna Faris Is Unqualified.  'Chris and I, we talk about this a lot,' she admitted. 'We grapple with a lot of the ideas of being a public couple.'  'I just remember feeling so hurt in a way that bothered me, because I didn't want to think of myself as somebody who could be affected by … tabloid s***.'  Saw it coming? Despite there being no suggestion Jennifer had any involvement in the split, fans flocked to social media in their droves  They married on the island of Bali two years later in July 2009, and share a four-year-old son, Jack.  'I take pride in how great my relationship is with Chris,' Anna continued.  'But having said that, of course, in this crazy world where he's off doing movies and I'm in LA raising our child, of course I'm going to feel vulnerable, like any normal human would.'  Watch this space? Fans put together the bizarre theory that Jennifer was involved in the split  Embrace: Though the ladies hugged it out in front of photographers, Anna appeared to have a pained expression while Lawrence kept her hands claw-like instead of fully touching  Pratt is now one of the most in-demand actors in Hollywood, with leading roles in Guardians Of The Galaxy, Jurassic World, The Lego Movie and The Magnificent Seven.  When asked how she deals with the rumors, Anna said 'I think it is to never respond; but she did admit 'My knee-jerk reaction was to be like 'f*ck you'.  The couple announced their split in a Facebook post on Sunday night, with Chris writing: 'Anna and I are sad to announce we are legally separating. We tried hard for a long time, and we're really disappointed.  'Our son has two parents who love him very much and for his sake we want to keep this situation as private as possible moving forward.  'We still have love for each other, will always cherish our time together and continue to have the deepest respect for one another.'  Claw-like: Jennifer kept her hands in an awkward position as she hugged her co-star's wife  The last time Pratt featured his wife on Instagram was in May when he gushed about the actress on Mother's Day.  Alongside a photo of Faris and their son, Pratt wrote: 'A big Mother's Day kiss and hug across the pond to my darling wife @annafaris and our sweet boy. I miss you both so much. I love you.'  Speaking back in late April at his Hollywood Walk of Fame star ceremony, Pratt affirmed how solid his and Faris' marriage appeared to be: 'I want to thank my wife Anna, I love you.  'You've given me so much. You gave me the greatest star in the galaxy in my little boy, I love him and I love you.  'We have bonded to make this molecule that is more important to me than air or water, and without it none of this means anything to me. With every challenge, with every day, week, month, decade, we become more bonded.  The promotion for the major films Pratt takes on also takes him around the world for weeks at a time, with Faris needing to stay in LA to shoot her sitcom, which records at Warner Brothers studios in Burbank.  It's been suggested that the split is partially down to the couple's hectic work schedules, with Faris busy with her sitcom and various other projects and Pratt taking on huge blockbuster movies.  He has spent most of this summer away in the UK and Hawaii shooting Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom; and although Faris and Jack visited him on location, Pratt's schedule would have been taxing on the family.  The promotion for the major films Pratt takes on also takes him around the world for weeks at a time, with Faris needing to stay in LA to shoot her sitcom, which records at Warner Brothers studios in Burbank.  'You make me laugh like nobody else. You're very caring, and thank you for your trust and your sacrifice - and for your dedication and your heart.  'I will do my best to protect it, and in return I will give you all of those things as well. You have my heart, my dedication, my trust.'  It's over: The couple (pictured on April 24) confirmed their shock marital split on Sunday  Due to separate career trajectories, Pratt has openly admitted they've struggled with his increasingly demanding work schedule over the last several years.  'It doesn't hurt that I'm with somebody who's been, for longer than me, super recognizable and famous and working nonstop,' Chris told BuzzFeed in December.  'It's a lot to ask somebody to understand, or expect somebody to understand, why you have to be away for so long. But she's, like, 'Dude, I get it, of course you have to go.''  And back in 2015, the Guardians of the Galaxy heartthrob defended that the globetrotting working streak would ultimately lead to 'the gravy years.'  'The way we work it out is we just take at least one moment every day to be present with one another,' Chris gushed to ET with Anna by his side.  'Whether or not we're in the same room, or the same state, or even the same country, we check in, you know?'  Jennifer has been dating director Darren Aronofsky, 48, for almost one year.

"""All the Ways Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's Wedding Broke Royal Tradition Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's wedding has been one for the history books—in part because of how the couple chose to do things their own way.  Here are all the ways their celebration broke from royal tradition:  Meghan is divorced.  Getty Images  There was a time when a senior royal having a relationship with a divorcee was seen as disastrous. Just 17 years after Edward VIII abdicated in order to marry the twice-divorced Wallis Simpson, Princess Margaret was forced to give up her love affair with Group Captain Peter Townsend.  And over half a century later, Prince Charles was able to finally marry his divorced long-term partner Camilla Parker-Bowles because of new ruling from the Church of England, but there was still public conflict surrounding the couple’s union.  But no more! Meghan has been welcomed into the Royal Family with open arms, and the British public approves of its new princess.  There wasn't a kiss on the Buckingham Palace balcony.  Ever since the weddings of Queen Victoria’s children, it has been customary for royal couples to take to the balcony at Buckingham Palace to acknowledge the crowds below.  Then in 1981, Charles and Diana were the first royal couple to share a kiss in front of the cheering crowds, later followed by Andrew and Sarah, and William and Kate. Because Harry and Meghan aren’t getting married in London, there was no balcony appearance–but that didn't stop them from sharing a kiss for the cameras in Windsor.  Getty Images  The bride and groom spent the night before their wedding in separate hotels.  Cliveden House Courtesy Cliveden House  Royal couples usually spend the night before their wedding at royal residences.Prince Charles and Prince Andrew both stayed at Buckingham Palace the night before their weddings, and their brides nearby at royal residence Clarence House. Although Kate stayed with her family at The Goring Hotel, William was at Clarence House the night before his big day, along with his brother Harry.  However it’s all different this time around. While there are several residences on the Windsor estate that could have served as a last-night base for Harry and Meghan, they chose to stay at Coworth Park and Cliveden House luxury hotels respectively.  The cake flavor came out of left field.  Royal weddings cakes are usually multi-tiered and highly traditional rich fruit cakes encased in marzipan and a thick crust of white icing, however Harry and Meghan have gone for lemon and elderflower cake covered with buttercream and fresh flowers, to capture the ‘bright flavours of Spring.’  🎥 Watch as baker Claire Ptak begins work on the #RoyalWedding Cake! pic.twitter.com/OTdcF9hc0a — The Royal Family (@RoyalFamily) May 18, 2018  Bridesmaids and pageboys weren't just from the royal side.  Getty Images  The royal protocol card is a pretty hefty one, and it has meant in the past that it trumps every aspect of a royal wedding. This usually means that most if not all of the bridesmaids and page boys are pulled from the royal pool.  Apart from Pippa Middleton, this was even the case as recently as William and Kate’s wedding in 2011, where all seven of the junior attendants were connected to William. However with Harry and Meghan, it was an entirely even split, with three of the six bridesmaids and two of the four page boys connected to the bride.  The bride wasn't be given away by her father.  Getty Images  Lest we forget. . . This is the one rule-bend that Harry and Meghan most definitely didn’t want, but the rollercoaster of events relating to Meghan’s side of the family in the lead up to her big day meant that there was a significant departure from the royal norm. Meghan’s father Thomas Markle was due to walk his daughter down the aisle, but after suffering a heart-attack and undergoing subsequent surgery three days before the wedding, he wasn’t well enough to fly, and in a surprise twist it was be Prince Charles who did the honors.  A very star-studded guest list  Getty Images  There is often a smattering of familiar faces at a royal wedding, but Harry and Megan’s big day was filled with a who’s who of celebrities from both side of the Atlantic, including George and Amal Clooney, Oprah Winfrey, Idris Elba, Tom Hardy, Serena Williams, David and Victoria Beckham, James Corden, Carey Mulligan and Marcus Mumford, and the cast of Suits.  Harry is wearing a wedding ring  Neither Harry’s grandfather Prince Philip nor brother Prince William wear wedding bands, and his father Prince Charles chooses to wear a signet ring on his pinkie finger, but Harry himself has chosen a platinum band which he will wear on his ring finger.  A ceremony with a significant multicultural content  Getty Images  The address given by the presiding bishop of the American Episcopal Church, Bishop Michael Curry, and he gave a rousing speech all about the power of love, opening with the words of civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr, “We must discover the power of love, the redemptive power of love. And when we do that, we will be able to make of this old world a new world. Love is the only way.” Later in the service, gospel singers the Kingdom Choir raised the roof with their rendition of the Ben E. King classic Stand By Me.  A spot of hand-holding  Getty Images  Harry and Meghan have already broken the royal mold on their royal engagements by holding hands as they arrive, and their tender physical interaction was also seen during the service. The couple broke with traditional royal protocol by holding hands throughout.""",/home/yanwang_nuist/dev_workspace/prj_python/fnd-bootstrap/dataset/gossip/Images/gossip_test/46GAE0mvqJPlOJy39bkT3xWA97fcVmG3.jpg,0.0

"""Kate and Leo: the 19-year friendship that's kept everyone guessing Leonardo DiCaprio enjoys meeting beautiful women on boats – anyone who has ever seen paparazzi photographs of the 41-year-old in his spare time could tell you that. But despite the endless run of supermodels, actresses and socialites who have latched on to his arm on various vessels over the years, only one (his mother aside), seems to have stayed the course. And she just so happens to have been the first, too.  Yesterday, as Sunday night’s action from the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood was digested, social media melted with nostalgic pride at clips of Kate Winslet, DiCaprio’s original maritime fling, watching her old friend sate his two-decade hunger for an Academy Award, with his performance as a post-watershed Ray Mears in the 19th-century survival epic the Revenant.  There was Leo, trussed up in a dinner jacket and reciting his speech with all the calm and poise of a man who has had too much time to practise, when the camera deliberately cut to a tearful Kate (herself a nominee, losing to Alicia Vikander in the Best Supporting Actress category).  Eyes fixed on stage, hands clasped in prayer, rocking back and forth: in another context, Winslet might have looked more like a deranged racehorse owner – but this was the Oscars, so any melodrama is forgiven.  As the footage circulated online, the internet briefly averted its gaze from Donald Trump, and oohed and ahhed with glee.  “LEO AND KATE ARE SO CUTE,” one person calmly Tweeted. “They are the pinnacle of friendship goals,” another concluded. Thousands of similar messages followed. Forget the prizes, controversies, dresses and jokes the night threw up, for many viewers the highlight of the 88th Academy Awards was the enduring tale of a strictly platonic friendship forged 19 years ago, on the deck of the Titanic.  Of course, both actors’ careers could easily have easily sunk with James Cameron’s epic story of that ill-fated cruise liner. Neither DiCaprio nor Winslet was an established lead when they were cast as Jack and Rose, so when Cameron’s film ran both well over-budget and far beyond schedule, that lack of star power was just one of many reasons industry critics doubted its success.  More fool them: Titanic became the first movie to gross more than a billion dollars, and instantly made the pair (then only 21 and 22 respectively) two of the most bankable actors in the world.  Looking at images of them together on the red carpet at the 1998 Oscars, they could scarcely seem further from the slick, seasoned professionals of 2016. DiCaprio has the air of a 12-year-old wearing his father’s spare suit to a school ball; while Winslet, in dark lipstick and black lace, looks more 'tormented adolescent going through a Goth phase’ than Hollywood star.  Photo: REX/Shutterstock  Still, that early success set them on course for careers of impressively even stead: both became critically acclaimed as well as box office stars, and for a long time both were united in an inability to claim the biggest prize of all, despite regular awards nominations (including Golden Globe nods for Revolutionary Road in 2008, their first on-screen reunion since the mid-Atlantic).  Things didn’t stay quite so even in their personal lives - while Winslet married for the third time in 2012 (guess who walked her down the aisle?), DiCaprio continues his diligent quest to date every model on earth for at least an evening.  When Winslet eventually got her Oscar for The Reader in 2008, at her sixth time of trying, DiCaprio was there at the front, cheering loudly. Last night, as he achieved his own dream, she did the same. Little wonder the world should feel warmed.  Floating selfishly on that Titanic door (which Jack could easily have squeezed onto), all those years ago, Rose might have reneged on her promise to never let go, but in real life, the pair never drifted apart. And now they’ve finally been reunited in the Oscars hall of fame.""",/home/yanwang_nuist/dev_workspace/prj_python/fnd-bootstrap/dataset/gossip/Images/gossip_test/fsgNUgJ53qu3p7goTyw8CmkMeYXiop1s.jpg,1.0

"""‘Go buy Ivanka’s stuff,’ Kellyanne Conway said. Then the first daughter’s fashion sales exploded. Ivanka Trump’s products weren’t always the hottest items online.  In January, for instance, the first daughter’s fashion line ranked No. 550 based on the number of orders from Lyst, the biggest fashion e-commerce website in the world, according to Forbes.  That changed dramatically the following month.  Sales of Trump’s products skyrocketed in early February, making her Lyst’s 11th most popular brand. The biggest spike, according to Lyst, came on Feb. 9, when sales jumped by 219 percent from the day before.  Yes, Feb. 9 — the same day that White House counselor Kellyanne Conway promoted Trump’s clothing and jewelry line on “Fox & Friends.”  “Go buy Ivanka’s stuff is what I would tell you,” Conway said. “I’m going to give a free commercial here. Go buy it today, everybody.”  And viewers did, apparently.    Sales of Ivanka Trump’s branded products skyrocketed on Feb. 9, the same day White House counselor Kellyanne Conway promoted the line on Fox News. (Lyst)  Abigail Klem, president of the Ivanka Trump brand, said in a statement that “the beginning of February” shows “the best performing weeks in the history of the brand.”  “For several different retailers, Ivanka Trump was a top performer online, and in some of the categories it was the best performance ever,” Klem said.  Sarah Tanner, Lyst’s spokeswoman, said increases in sales are usually tied to current events. For instance, interest in pantsuits went up by 460 percent last year because of Hillary Clinton’s affinity for the style, she said. Sales of the first daughter’s products went up by 86 percent in November when her father won the presidential election, according to the company.  [A Trump wine boycott backfires spectacularly]  But the brand was “largely featured” in the news in February, Tanner said. Conway gave her on-air endorsement of Ivanka Trump’s brand after President Trump had complained on Twitter that his daughter had “been treated so unfairly” by the department store Nordstrom, which dropped her clothing line over slow sales.  “It would not be a surprise to us if it resulted in the increase in sales,” Tanner said of Conway’s Fox interview. “I think that’s one of the reasons the brand was largely in the news and could have attributed to this increase.”  Conway did not respond to an email requesting comment. Her promotion of the fashion line appeared to violate an ethics rule barring federal employees from using their public office to endorse products and immediately drew criticism from both Democrats and Republicans.  [Where does the Ivanka Trump brand go from here?]  Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah), chairman of the House Oversight Committee, said Conway’s comments were “absolutely wrong, wrong, wrong” and “clearly over the line,” The Washington Post reported.  The White House later said that Conway had been “counseled.” But concerns about her comments remain.  On Thursday, the government’s top ethics official criticized the White House for not disciplining Conway, The Post’s Drew Harwell reported. Walter M. Shaub Jr., director of the Office of Government Ethics, had urged officials last month to reprimand the White House counsel but was rebuffed. On Thursday he wrote to Stefan C. Passantino, who handles White House ethics issues as the president’s deputy counsel.  “When an employee’s conduct violates, disciplinary action serves to deter future misconduct,” Shaub wrote. “Not taking disciplinary action against a senior official under such circumstances risks undermining the ethics program.”  [A Trump voter’s message to retailers: ‘Keep your mouths shut about our president’]  Last month, a group of law professors filed a professional misconduct complaint against Conway — a law school graduate and member of the D.C. Bar — partly because of her on-air endorsement of Trump’s products.  According to Lyst, February drew unusually large numbers of orders across many Ivanka Trump-branded products, including dresses, shoes, pants, coats, knitwear and tops. Heels were the bestsellers, followed by dresses.  “We’ve never seen such a large uptick,” Tanner said. “Typically, she’s not in our top 100 sellers.”  Comparing February’s numbers with last year’s average number of orders of Ivanka Trump products shows a difference of 557 percent. (Tanner said company policy prohibits her from sharing the actual numbers of online sales.)  The excitement of the brand, however, may be slumping. The company’s numbers show sales were gradually tapering off toward the end of February. March does not appear to be as remarkable, but sales are still on track to be about 8 percent better than they were in January, according to Lyst.  [Watchdogs ask U.S. attorney to investigate Trump over foreign business deals]  The Ivanka Trump brand also appears to have weathered an aggressive boycott campaign called Grab Your Wallet, which began in October and encouraged shoppers to avoid retailers that stock Trump-branded products.  1 of 68 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad × Ivanka Trump: A life in the spotlight View Photos Here’s a look at Ivanka Trump’s early life of privilege and transformation into a business executive, first daughter and adviser to the U.S. president.

Yana Paskova/For The Washington Post Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue.  Some retailers have partially or completely distanced themselves from the Trump brand. Nordstrom, Neiman Marcus and Belk have stopped selling Trump’s branded line of clothing, shoes and jewelry. T.J. Maxx and Marshalls have instructed employees to stop promoting Trump products in stores and to move Trump clothing into general merchandise racks. Sears Holdings and subsidiary Kmart discontinued online sales of 31 items from the Trump Home collection last month, though their websites still contain items sold by third-party sellers. The collection includes living room and bedroom furniture, lamps and chandeliers.  The companies attributed their decisions to product performance. Nordstrom, for instance, said sales of the brand have steadily declined, particularly in the last half of 2016.  Still, despite the boycott, Trump’s line of fragrances enjoyed top spots in Amazon’s best-selling list last month, The Post’s Amy B Wang reported. The Ivanka Trump Eau de Parfum spray was the top-selling item in the “Perfumes & Fragrances” category.

"""Is Meghan Markle liked by the Queen MORE than Kate? Newlywed set to ride Queen's train The Queen, Prince Philip, Prince Charles and Camilla are all entitled to ride the Royal rail, but not even the Duchess of Sussex’s husband or the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have ever used it on an official basis. Engagements attended by the Duchess of Sussex and the Queen will mark the newlywed’s first solo event with her husband’s grandmother. Such an occasion comes incredibly quickly following her marriage into the Royal Family and marks a stark contrast to the Duchess of Cambridge. The Duchess of Cambridge did not partake in an engagement with the Queen alone until almost a year into her marriage with Prince William.  The Queen, Prince Philip, Prince Charles and Camilla are all entitled to ride the Royal rail  Such a move could suggest the Duchess of Sussex has formed a close bond to the head of the monarchy. In March 2012 the Duchess of Cambridge attended Fortnum and Mason with Her Majesty in London’s Piccadilly area to mark the store’s renovated restaurant area. However, Camilla also attended, meaning the event was not technically a solo outing for the Duchess of Cambridge with the Queen.

"""Taylor Swift rips off dress in controversial new music video Just after winning Female Artist of the Year at the iHeartRadio Music Awards, Taylor Swift dropped a new music video for “Delicate,” a track from her latest album, “Reputation.”  Like much of the album, the song hones in on Swift’s public perception over the past year or so.  The video opens with a vacant-looking Swift on the red carpet, dressed in a flapper-inspired sapphire gown and mobbed by reporters and photographers.  She escapes to her dressing room, where the songstress makes funny faces at herself in the mirror. She’s interrupted by a group of women, and when she turns back to the mirror, she realizes she can’t see her reflection anymore.  This realization sets off a string of impromptu “La La Land”-esque dance moves — some of which are painfully awkward to watch.  About a minute and a half in, things get crazy: The singer whips off the bottom of her gown, revealing a sassy, shorter version of her fringy frock.  The weird dance moves and the dramatic disrobing aren’t even the most buzzed-about bits of the video, though. Critics say Swift’s video is a ripoff of Spike Jonze’s 2016 Kenzo commercial (starring “The Leftovers” actress Margaret Qualley).  “Anybody else notice that the @taylorswift13 ‘Delicate’ music video ripped off Spike Jonze’s Kenzo video? It’s almost beat-for-beat, just with worse dancing,” one whistleblower tweets.  “Taylor Swift’s ‘Delicate’ video is a poor man’s version of Spike Jonze’s ad for Kenzo,” tweets another.  Naturally, Swift’s die-hard fans couldn’t care less about the Kenzo controversy.  “@taylorswift13 dancing in a storm in her best dress because she’s fearless and it doesn’t get better than this in the ‘Delicate’ video is everything,” tweets a loyalist.

"""The Enduring Appeal of the Fairy-Tale Wedding For those aspiring fairy-tale brides unable to shell out $180,000—which is what Disney’s ultimate fairy tale will set you back—there are other, cheaper ways to feel like a princess. After their weddings, according to Otnes, Princess Diana and Kate Middleton each transformed the wedding-dress industry. “Diana got married in a big, poofy dress with puffed sleeves, Kate in a lacy, fitted gown. The dresses became immediate sources of emulation. There is a reason everyone is waiting with bated breath to find out what Meghan will wear,” said Otnes (who will be celebrating the wedding with her colleagues, wearing fascinator hats and enjoying a British high tea).  The fairy-tale wedding dates back to 15th-century Venice, when a writer named Giovanni Francesco Straparola invented what is now recognized as the standard happy ending. “Before this point, at the end of fairy tales, you had the prince and princess living as hermits, not getting married, waiting to receive their ultimate rewards in heaven,” said Ruth Bottigheimer, a professor at Stony Brook University who specializes in fairy tales. “The new happy ending takes place here on earth, and it takes the shape of a wedding.” Classic fairy-tale weddings involve at least one royal, Bottigheimer said, “because that’s where the money is—the power.” In mid-19th-century Germany, the era of the Brothers Grimm, fairy tales were widely taught in schools. At that point, Bottigheimer said, “the happily-ever-after plot gets injected into the whole European population.”  The fairy-tale wedding—as a consumable good, not a fictional happy ending—arrived in the United States in the 1950s, says Stephanie Coontz, a professor of marriage and family history at Evergreen State College. When World War II ended, marriage rates skyrocketed. Women, employed during the war while the men were away, left the workplace in droves and got married. In 1950, the average age of marriage for women was 20. “If you waited four or five years after that, you’d be labeled a spinster,” Coontz said. In the midst of that pressure, the wedding industry identified an enormous opportunity, using ads to convince women that their wedding would be the biggest day of their lives. At the same time, Disney debuted its rendition of the world’s most famous fictional princess: When it came out in 1950, Cinderella—which ends, of course, in a gilded royal wedding—was, by one count, the highest-grossing film of the year. And so began what Coontz calls “the relentless pursuit of the princess.”  There was something special about Cinderella. In the sweet girl next door who talks to birds and sleeps in the kitchen, Coontz told me, women saw themselves. “This idea that someone who can support you at that level of opulence chooses you, instead of a blue blood … that is a very attractive fantasy,” Coontz says. Particularly after Grace Kelly—another “commoner” (who, yes, happened to be a wildly famous actress)—married Prince Rainier of Monaco in 1956, the fairy-tale wedding suddenly felt, well, if not within reach, then at least something worth fantasizing about. The most recent royal marriages, according to Coontz, have been so popular because they play out the same storyline: Rich, royal dude swoops in to save a regular girl from a lifetime of oppressive normality. (Both Middleton and Markle were considered “commoners” at the time of their engagements, though genealogists have since claimed distant royal ties.) “In the past, kings and princes couldn’t marry commoners, so there was no point in fantasizing about it much,” Coontz said. “Now we’ve seen the idea of a ‘love match’ become a reality.”""",/home/yanwang_nuist/dev_workspace/prj_python/fnd-bootstrap/dataset/gossip/Images/gossip_test/HAVomW9YMyTyllYtGr9poyNrOvuQ8cae.jpg,1.0
"""Jenna Dewan Says Her Divorce From Channing Tatum Was “a Positive Thing” Since announcing their separation after almost nine years of marriage in April, dancer and World of Dance judge Jenna Dewan and actor Channing Tatum have remained relatively mum on details of their divorce. But in a new cover story for Women’s Health, Dewan opened up on life post-Tatum, where she talked finding personal growth in a time of intense scrutiny.  “I feel I’ve been on a wave of growth,” Dewan told the magazine. “It’s always challenging to go through a big change and have the whole world have an opinion about it. . . It’s okay for a relationship to change into a new form that is actually better for both people involved, and I think that’s maybe what shocked everyone so much—that it can be a positive thing. That was ultimately what happened with us.”  Dewan said the mutual separation was a positive decision, and that it felt right for the family as a whole. (She and Tatum have a five-year-old daughter, Everly). “It’s been a journey, and it’s been a transformation of myself—my needs and wants as a woman,” she said. “I think everyone wants to hold on to what’s in front of them, but when you open your mind, saying, ‘I want what’s best for myself and my daughter,’ you have to be okay with however that looks.”  The couple had been together since 2006, when they met on the set of the dance flick Step Up. They later went on to tie the knot in 2009, and welcomed their daughter in 2013.  Elsewhere in the interview, Dewan also spoke about her experiences as a mother—and the mom-shaming that can sometimes come with it. (She recently faced criticism for posting so-called “too-sexy” photos on Instagram.) “Apparently, when you become a mother, you’re supposed to leave your sexuality at the door, and I never understood that,” she said of the experience. “I think there’s nothing sexier than becoming a mother. You give life. It’s everything. And you don’t change who you are inside just because you have a kid.”""",/home/yanwang_nuist/dev_workspace/prj_python/fnd-bootstrap/dataset/gossip/Images/gossip_test/F9F4E0Eh02piWO25ES0zvVyQYAh8urTA.jpg,1.0

Britney Spears‘ return to her Piece of Me Las Vegas residency after a summer hiatus got off to a terrifying start when a fan rushed the stage.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  The incident occurred Wednesday night just as the 35-year-old pop star finished performing “(You Drive Me) Crazy” towards the end of her set at the AXIS auditorium inside Planet Hollywood Resort & Casino. In a video obtained by TMZ, Spears engaged the crowd, initially unaware that a man had climbed onto the stage, attempting to get her attention. Quick-thinking dancers encircled the crasher until security agents arrived onstage and surrounded the headliner.  X17Online/YouTube  “Is something OK?” Spears asked. “What’s going on? What’s wrong?” Then — visibly frightened — she gasped, “He’s got a gun?” Her mic was switched off as she was rushed to safety offstage. Loyal fans voiced their support, chanting, “We love you!”  (Warning: The video above contains graphic language.)  The man (who did not have a gun) struggled with security, even kicking a member of the force as he executed a cartwheel. Muscular members of her dance squad gathered to subdue the man until more security guards arrived, at which point the intruder was restrained and escorted offstage to chants of “A–hole! from the crowd. Before he was ejected from the theater, the man succeeded in kneeing one of the guards.

Along with the rest of the halftime show, it led to an immediate crackdown and widespread debate on perceived indecency in broadcasting.[1] The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) fined CBS a record US$550,000 which was fought in the Supreme Court,[4] but that fine was appealed and ultimately voided by the Third Circuit Court of Appeals in a 2011 ruling, and a case to reinstate the fine was refused in 2012.[5][6]  The incident was ridiculed both within the United States and abroad, with a number of commentators considering the incident a planned publicity stunt,[7] and American commentators in particular viewing it as a sign of decreasing morality in American culture, while others considered the incident harmless and argued that it received an undue amount of attention and backlash.[8][9][10][11][12] The increased regulation of broadcasting raised concerns regarding censorship and free speech in the United States,[13] and the FCC increased the fine per indecency violation from US$27,500 to US$325,000 shortly after the event.[14] The halftime show that year was produced by MTV and was themed around the network's Choose or Lose campaign due to the event occurring during a presidential election year. Following the wardrobe incident, the National Football League (NFL) announced that MTV, which also produced the halftime show for Super Bowl XXXV, would not be involved in any halftime shows in the future.[15] The MTV Chief Executive stated in an interview with Reuters that Jackson engineered the stunt, while Timberlake was informed of it just moments before he took the stage.[16][17] The exposure was broadcast to a total audience of 143.6 million viewers.[18]  YouTube co-founder Jawed Karim claims that this incident was what led to the creation of the video sharing website.[19][20] The incident also made """"Janet Jackson"""" the most searched term, event, and image in Internet history, as well as the most searched person and term of 2004 and 2005.[21][22][23][24] The incident also broke the record for """"most searched event over one day"""".[25] Jackson was later listed in the 2007 edition of Guinness World Records as """"Most Searched in Internet History"""" and the """"Most Searched for News Item"""".[26] It became the most watched, recorded and replayed television moment in TiVo history and """"enticed an estimated 35,000 new [TiVo] subscribers to sign up"""".[27][28][29] The incident also coined the phrase """"wardrobe malfunction"""", which was later added to the Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary.[30]  Following the incident, CBS parent company Viacom, and their co-owned subsidiaries MTV and Infinity Broadcasting, enforced a blacklist of Jackson's singles and music videos on many radio formats and music channels worldwide.[31] As of 2018, neither Jackson nor Timberlake are banned from the halftime show.[32] Timberlake later performed at Super Bowl LII on February 4, 2018.  Background and development [ edit ]  In 2002, Entertainment Weekly reported that Jackson was the original choice to perform at the halftime show for Super Bowl XXXVI, however the NFL ultimately decided to select U2 to headline it after a group of NFL owners and officials attended the band's concert in New York City shortly after the September 11 attacks.[33] In September 2003, the NFL announced that Jackson would be the headline performer of the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show.[34] Because the event was occurring during an election year, MTV decided that the show's theme would heavily focus on the network's """"Choose or Lose"""" campaign, which encouraged younger viewers to be politically active and register to vote.[35]  Prior to the incident, Timberlake had attended Jackson's Rhythm Nation Tour as an adolescent, and Jackson's energetic dance routines and daring performing style made a deep impression on him.[36] While Timberlake was a member of pop group 'N Sync, Jackson selected the boy band as the opening act for many dates of her blockbuster Velvet Rope World Tour, which helped promote and introduce the then-relatively unknown group and Timberlake to the public worldwide.[37] Timberlake said he was """"psyched"""" and later described the experience as """"fulfilling"""".[38][39] While on the tour, Jackson further promoted the group by performing with 'N Sync on several dates, including joining the group for a live a cappella duet of Stevie Wonder's """"Overjoyed"""", which a biography stated was a """"highlight"""" moment for Timberlake which """"gave Justin a chance to show his family and friends how far he had come"""".[40] Following the tour, Timberlake and Jackson became """"good friends"""", with Jackson also praising Timberlake.[41] Timberlake recreated Jackson's """"That's the Way Love Goes"""" video with 'N Sync and was inspired by Jackson's performing style.[42]  Timberlake had frequently mentioned admiring Jackson in many interviews during this time and throughout the following few years preceding the incident.[38][39][43] When asked who he thought was """"the sexiest woman on the planet"""", Timberlake had said """"I've thought Janet Jackson has nothing but sex appeal, so I'd probably say her.""""[44]  Timberlake later asked Jackson to sing backing vocals on """"(And She Said) Take Me Now"""", a song from his debut solo album Justified which was initially planned to be released as a single, commenting """"I wrote the chorus from a girl's perspective, and I just thought we should get a female on the part. Her name was the first that popped up in my head just because I love her voice. It sounds like feathers. I mean, she sounds like an angel.""""[45]  Incident [ edit ]  During the halftime show, Jackson performed a medley of hits, beginning with """"All for You"""", """"Rhythm Nation"""" and a brief excerpt of """"The Knowledge"""" before surprise guest Timberlake appeared to perform a duet of his song """"Rock Your Body"""" with Jackson.[46][47] The performance featured several suggestive dance moves by both singers, and as Timberlake reached his final line of """"Rock Your Body"""", """"I'm gonna have you naked by the end of this song"""", Timberlake pulled off a part of Jackson's costume, revealing her right breast, partially covered by a piece of nipple jewelry, for less than a second (after which the CBS broadcast immediately cut to an aerial view of Reliant Stadium). MTV's CEO Tom Freston claimed in an interview with the Reuters news agency that the exposure was a stunt orchestrated by Jackson.[48] Jackson's publicist stated the performance ending was only supposed to reveal Jackson's red lace bra, though the lace undergarment was accidentally removed along with the outer layer.[8][49]  Responses [ edit ]  """"It's truly embarrassing for me to know that 90 million [140 million] people saw my breast, and then to see it blown up on the Internet the size of a computer screen ..."""" """"But there are much worse things in the world, and for this to be such a focus, I don't understand"""". – Jackson on Super Bowl incident.[50]  MTV stated, """"The tearing of Janet Jackson's costume was unrehearsed, unplanned, completely unintentional and was inconsistent with assurances we had about the content of the performance. MTV regrets this incident occurred and we apologize to anyone who was offended by it.""""[51] The network also said, """"Our goal with the Super Bowl Halftime show was to produce an entertaining stage experience with a positive message about empowerment and voting. We are disappointed that this message has been overshadowed by the unfortunate incident"""".[52] A statement from CBS read, """"We attended all rehearsals throughout the week and there was no indication that any such thing would happen. The moment did not conform to CBS broadcast standards and we would like to apologize to anyone who was offended.""""[51] Viacom President Mel Karmazin said that while the company can be proud of 99% of what people saw on the broadcast, it understands """"what a difference one percent can make"""". NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue said the show produced by MTV, which like CBS, was owned by Viacom at the time (before the two networks were respectively separated into Viacom and CBS Corporation, both controlled by National Amusements, in December 2005), fell far short of the """"tasteful, first-class entertainment"""" the league expected. FCC Chairman Michael Powell, appearing before a Senate panel, called the Super Bowl incident """"a new low for prime time television"""".[53][54] Joe Browne, Executive Vice President of the NFL, said, """"We were extremely disappointed by elements of the MTV-produced Halftime show. They were totally inconsistent with assurances our office was given about the show. It's unlikely that MTV will produce another Super Bowl halftime.""""[51] An hour-long MTV documentary titled """"Making the Super Bowl Halftime Show"""" was scheduled to premiere the following week but was canceled before it ever aired and has never been broadcast subsequently.[55][56]  Salli Frattini, the executive producer for MTV who had planned the entire performance, recalled a phone call from the officiating booth that was her first indication something had gone wrong. Frattini was in a truck outside of Reliant Stadium celebrating the end of the 12-minute halftime performance, which they initially thought was a success. """"We were like, 'Uh, we’re playing that back right now'"""", Frattini said. """"There was lots of chaos in the truck, and we played it back and we were like, 'Oh, s[hit]. What just happened?'"""" Alex Coletti, another MTV producer, said he could not find Jackson after the performance. """"I tried to get in touch to make sure she was okay"""", he said. """"Her entire camp stopped answering the phones. I finally got to her tour manager, and they were already at the airport."""" Coletti assumed the singer was so mortified that she fled immediately, though later assumed the incident was a possible """"set up"""", adding it was the last time he had spoken to her. Coletti's assumption is potentially another reason for Jackson's blacklisting on MTV in addition to other music channels and radio formats.[57] An MTV representative confirmed the costume tear was conceptualized by the MTV staff, in which the show's producers mockingly ripped their clothing in response to Timberlake's closing lyric during rehearsals. This led to Jackson and Timberlake improvising the move, in which Timberlake tore off Jackson's kilt. Frattini stated, """"When we did the original rehearsal, there was conversation about a fake skirt she would wear, and that Justin would actually pull open the skirt and take off the skirt. In rehearsal, they actually tried to rip open the skirt, which kind of went with the lyrics of the song"""".[8] The production team then discussed another option, which led to the costume tearing, although the outfit was intended to stay in place.[8]  Jackson's representative explained the incident, saying, """"Justin was supposed to pull away the rubber bustier to reveal a red lace bra. The garment collapsed and her breast was accidentally revealed.""""[58] CBS forced Jackson to release a video apology, and said """"My decision to change the Super Bowl performance was made after the final rehearsal. MTV, CBS, [and] the NFL had no knowledge of this whatsoever and unfortunately, the whole thing went wrong in the end. I am really sorry if I offended anyone, that was truly not my intention"""". A written statement read, """"The decision to have a costume reveal at the end of my halftime show performance was made after final rehearsals. MTV was completely unaware of it. It was not my intention that it go as far as it did. I apologize to anyone offended – including the audience, MTV, CBS and the NFL.""""[52] Due to the event being accidental and unintentional, Jackson refused to release another apology statement to media outlets following this. Speaking to USA Today, Jackson said, """"It's truly embarrassing for me to know that 90 million [140 million] people saw my breast, and then to see it blown up on the Internet the size of a computer screen ... but there are much worse things in the world, and for this to be such a focus, I don't understand.""""[50] Regarding continued backlash, she responded, """"Who knows...Maybe they'll get mad at something that I do in my show, but at least it won't be new to me, since I've already gone through all of this. But I feel very positive that things are going to work out just fine. Everything happens for a reason.""""[50]  Publicist Marvet Britto stated, """"Jackson embodies grace, style and integrity...She has never been known as a bad person."""" Britto describes Jackson’s videotaped apology as """"impersonal"""", saying, """"She has never been an impersonal artist, so it made it seem like she was guilty of something, and she wasn't. I would have had her and Timberlake apologizing side by side right from the beginning, since they performed side by side. Otherwise, it made the whole apology seem calculated and contrived."""" Jackson said of the apology, """"I probably should have done it live. But there was so much going on at the time that I needed to just get it done. It is what it is. And it will pass, and I'm fine with it.""""[59] At one point Jackson was scheduled to be interviewed about the incident by Diane Sawyer on the ABC newsmagazine Primetime, however, the interview never came to fruition.[60] Jackson later briefly discussed the incident on Good Morning America and the Late Show with David Letterman. Jackson's outfit was designed by famed designer Alexander McQueen, with Jackson later commenting """"I don't blame him; he didn't rip it. Alexander is so great at what he does – he's a genius.""""[61] In an interview with Australia's Herald Sun, Jackson commented on Timberlake (whom, as mentioned, Jackson had previously known personally and aided when she selected his former group 'N Sync to open for her Velvet Rope World Tour at the start of their career[36][38]) distancing himself from the incident and seemingly changing with fame. """"I really want to be honest about this, but I just feel that anything I say about him will be taken the wrong way"""", said Jackson. """"I do think that Justin is very talented and that he has a very big career ahead of him. But he seems to have changed recently. He's gotten a bit cocky. You know, some people can handle success and some people can't. I'm starting to wonder if (the latter) is the case with Justin. And it hurts me to say that.""""[62] Producer Jimmy Jam revealed Jackson considered writing a song about the incident for her Damita Jo album, saying, """"I don't know whether it will or not. But I have a feeling it probably will, because kind of whatever's happening in her life tends to be what she writes about [...] It'd be kind of interesting to see what her feeling is about it.""""[63]  famine, homelessness, """"[The furor] is hypocritical, with everything you see on TV. There are more important thing to focus on than a woman's body part, which is a beautiful thing. There's war AIDS . [...] They needed something to focus on instead of the war, and I was the perfect vehicle for that. [...] People are going to think what they want. It was an accident. It was not a stunt. That was embarrassing for me to have all those people see my breast."""" – Jackson questioning media's focus on the event.[50]  Michael Musto of The Village Voice commented on the media's reaction to the incident, saying, """"Janet became a symbolic Joan of Arc to burn at the stake. I actually do think her breast was used as a diversionary tactic – I'm not sure to distract from Iraq specifically – but it did distract from important issues, from things we actually should be appalled by. The story got an undue amount of attention when the fact is, nobody has proved how her breast harmed anyone.""""[64] Speaking to Robert Tannenbaum of Blender Magazine, Jackson had strong, if guarded, views on the reactions, saying the furor """"is hypocritical, with everything you see on TV. There are more important thing to focus on than a woman's body part, which is a beautiful thing. There's war, famine, homelessness, AIDS"""". The fact that it happened in an election year """"did have a great deal to do with it. They needed something to focus on instead of the war, and I was the perfect vehicle for that. People are going to think what they want. It was an accident. It was not a stunt. That was embarrassing for me to have all those people see my breast. That's like having your penis hanging out in front of millions and millions of people.""""[31]Janet declared the reaction to the accidental exposure as """"contradictory"""", noting it to occur in an era where commercials for beer and Viagra are both """"very sexual"""" and """"practically omnipresent"""".[64] Jackson also said the mishap was """"not intentional"""" and a """"costume accident"""", also commenting on some media outlets editing her taped apology, saying, """"Sometimes they cut out that I said it was an accident...That's what the media does, that's the way they are because they want it to be told a different way.""""[65] In Glamour Magazine, Janet exclaimed, """"It's hard to believe that there's a war and famine going on in the world and yet people made such a big deal about a breast. People said that it was done intentionally to sell records. Do you know what? I have never pulled a stunt. Why would you do that and have your album come out two months later? It doesn't make sense."""" In the ensuing months, Janet felt overwhelmed by the hostility towards her. """"People think I'm immune to being hurt by what's said. They ask me questions that shock me. Not everybody is as strong as the next person and words can kill. People push you and you start to think, 'Can I handle this?' But I know I can.""""[66]  Immediately following the incident, Timberlake sounded unapologetic for his actions, telling Access Hollywood, """"Hey man, we love giving you all something to talk about.""""[49] Timberlake released a statement saying """"I am sorry that anyone was offended by the wardrobe malfunction during the halftime performance of the Super Bowl. It was not intentional and is regrettable.""""[51] However, Timberlake was not required to film a video apology as Jackson was. Timberlake also addressed the incident at the Grammy Awards the following week, which Jackson was banned from attending after being scheduled as a presenter, saying """"I know it's been a rough week on everybody. What occurred was unintentional, completely regrettable and I apologize if you guys are offended.""""[67] Timberlake gave an additional interview at the Grammy event and stated, """"All I could say was, 'Oh, my God. Oh, my God,'"""" Timberlake said. """"I looked at her. They brought a towel up on stage. They covered her up. I was completely embarrassed and just walked off the stage as quickly as I could. I'm frustrated at the whole situation. I'm frustrated that my character is being questioned. And the fact of the matter is, you know, I've had a good year, a really good year, especially with my music.""""[68] Timberlake later declared, """"It was something that went wrong. Then I felt like, I'm going to show everyone that this was something that didn't affect me, and I'm going to show up at the Grammys.""""[69] He later said he was unable to attend most of the halftime rehearsals due to being on tour in Spain, having only one day to rehearse.[70] While promoting his sophomore album FutureSex/LoveSounds over two years later, Timberlake expressed regret for his behavior, saying, """"In my honest opinion now ... I could've handled it better. ... I'm part of a community that consider themselves artists. And if there was something I could have done in her defense that was more than I realized then, I would have. But the other half of me was like, 'Wow. We still haven't found the weapons of mass destruction and everybody cares about this!'"""" He added, """"I probably got 10 percent of the blame, and that says something about society ... I think that America's harsher on women. And I think that America is, you know, unfairly harsh on ethnic people.""""[71]  Media diversion [ edit ]  Jackson suspected ulterior motives in the media's reaction, expressing, """"It was just perfect timing to take people's focus off of other things. That's what happens, and it happened to me.""""[50] Accounts from several university leaders and management groups offered a similar premise. Michael Rich, director of Harvard's Center on Media and Child Health, exclaimed, """"Here we have Michael Powell upset about the happening in the Super Bowl, but the same Powell has been unwilling to do anything about the violence on television, where there has been much more research showing it has a harmful impact on kids."""" Robert Thompson, founding director of the Center for the Study of Popular Television at Syracuse University, said, """"Michael Powell is representing the Super Bowl like everybody in the family sits around knitting booties, or like, it's the Macy's Day Parade. [...] Come on. There's gambling, there's a lot of drinking, partying, a carnival atmosphere"""", he asserted. Jay Rosenthal, attorney for the Recording Artists' Coalition, says the FCC's involvement was a smoke-screen, or a """"sound bite attempt"""" by the Republican-led commission to act as if it's doing something. """"When it comes to media consolidation issues affecting consumers and artists, they don't care about that. But when it comes to indecency, after ignoring it for years, all of a sudden they're snapping to attention"""", he said. Simon Renshaw of management group The Firm stated it to be """"inappropriate"""" that Powell is trying to distract people from the real issues of what's currently going on in the media. """"What I find offensive is CBS' refusal to carry MoveOn.org's ad during the Super Bowl"""", which pictured children working in factories to pay off the Bush administration's budget deficit.[72] The Boston Legal episode """"Let Sales Ring"""" likened the incident to being used as a distraction, portraying a news corporation which used the mishap to attract attention over other important events in the media.[73] Daniel Kreps of Rolling Stone explained, """"For the FCC, Nipplegate provided an opportunity to restore order and flex whatever power they had left. Faced with lax broadcast standards for cable TV and satellite radio, as well as the absolute lawlessness of the Internet, the FCC becomes hell-bent on preserving common decency in the family-friendly realm of network television. Thus, screws are tightened everywhere under the body's jurisdiction: Tape delays are lengthened and more frequent and sexually suggestive performances are replaced by less provocative selections. While the aftermath of Nipplegate starts to fade, the FCC will continue to carry its torch for the next half-decade.""""[74] Cynthia Fuchs of Popmatters stated, """"It behooves TV producers and consumers to focus their attentions on significant """"news"""", rather than the daily distractions offered up by politicians, performers, professional spinners, and journalists. Janet is not that person you watch on TV. And neither is anyone else.""""[75]  Powell's response [ edit ]  A decade after the incident, former FCC chairman Michael Powell gave his first interview regarding Jackson's performance, saying Jackson was treated unfairly and the controversy, including his own reaction, was completely overblown. Powell stated, """"I think we've been removed from this long enough for me to tell you that I had to put my best version of outrage on that I could put on. Part of it was surreal, right? Look, I think it was dumb to happen, and they knew the rules and were flirting with them, and my job is to enforce the rules, but, you know, really? This is what we're gonna do?"""" Powell also said the treatment of Jackson, who was lambasted for causing """"an outrageous stunt"""", was unfair, and commented on Timberlake not receiving the same backlash. """"I personally thought that was really unfair"""", he said. """"It all turned into being about her. In reality, if you slow the thing down, it’s Justin ripping off her breastplate.""""[57]  Public reaction [ edit ]  United States [ edit ]  In the United States, the exposure of Jackson's breast by Timberlake led to much media attention and headlines, in which it was sometimes referred to as """"Nipplegate"""".[2][3] The socially conservative media watchdog group Parents Television Council (PTC) issued a statement that same day condemning the halftime show, announcing that their members would file indecency complaints with the FCC and the council supported the Commission's decision to investigate the halftime show immediately.[76] In addition, the FCC received nearly 540,000 complaints from Americans,[15] with the PTC claiming responsibility for around 65,000 of them.[77] In its appeal to the Third Circuit Court, CBS disputed how many of the complaints were filed by individual, non-organized viewers.[78] Columnists L. Brent Bozell III[9] (who also founded the Parents Television Council) and Phyllis Schlafly[12] also expressed criticism of the halftime show in their weekly columns. Democratic senator Zell Miller of Georgia, both on the floor of the United States Senate[11] and in an editorial on Salon.com,[10] denounced the halftime show as what he perceived as declining morality in America. The day immediately following the Super Bowl, then-FCC chairman Michael Powell ordered an investigation into the halftime show..[1] Timberlake told CBS owned-and-operated station KCBS-TV in Los Angeles a few days following the Super Bowl that even his own family was offended by the mishap at the end of the halftime show.[79] However, an Associated Press poll taken nearly three weeks after the Super Bowl found that although 54% of American adults considered the exposure distasteful, only 18% supported the FCC's investigation.[80] Film director Spike Lee, speaking at Kent State University at Stark on February 3, called the incident a """"new low"""" in entertainment.[2]  The Super Bowl controversy was also a subject of humor on all of the late-night talk shows. For example, CBS's own Late Show with David Letterman mocked the incident all week following the Super Bowl. Host David Letterman jokingly commented on the controversy the day after the Super Bowl that he """"was happy to see this thing happen ... because that meant for one night I wasn't the biggest boob on CBS"""".[81] The next day, he also joked that President George W. Bush formed a """"Department of Wardrobe Security"""" to prevent further wardrobe malfunctions.[82] On February 4, Letterman opened his monologue by joking about having a wardrobe malfunction.[83] Additionally, the Top Ten Lists featured on the program on that same night[84] briefly referenced the incident. Jackson's appearance on the Late Show the following month increased the show's ratings 20% from the program's usual weeknight opener.[85] Larry King also stated Jackson jokingly gave him a pair of suspenders with open holes around the nipples, commenting """"I wore them once, they were cute.""""[86] Democratic presidential candidate Howard Dean called the FCC's investigation """"silly"""", commenting """"In general, I think the FCC does have a role in promoting some reasonable standard of decency. However, considering what's on television these days, I think the FCC is being pretty silly about investigating this."""" Dean added """"I don't find it terribly shocking relative to some of the things you can find on standard cable television. I think the FCC probably has a lot of other things they should be pursuing.""""[87]  South Park (aired on Comedy Central, a sister network to CBS at the time, and to MTV through Viacom) took aim at the hysteria in its eighth season premiere, """"Good Times with Weapons"""", on March 17 of that year when Eric Cartman sneaks across a stage in the nude and later blames the incident on a """"wardrobe malfunction"""". The townspeople are angered by Cartman's display, rather than feeling concern for a badly injured and disoriented character (Butters) who is also present on stage – a reference to the American culture's acceptance of violence while maintaining a taboo against nudity.[88] During the 2004 MTV Video Music Awards, comedian Dave Chappelle joked that his appearance on the VMAs was """"the biggest mistake [MTV made] since [they] put Janet Jackson on the Super Bowl.""""[89] Family Guy also did an episode based around the """"wardrobe malfunction"""" and the FCC's crackdown on """"indecent"""" content, with one scene parodying the incident directly.[90] The fourth season episode """"PTV"""" involved actor David Hyde Pierce having a trouser malfunction at the Emmys. The FCC's sudden crackdown on indecent material on television leads an angered Peter Griffin to start his own network with looser content standards, PTV, on which later in the same episode, he presents a show called the """"Side Boob Hour"""" which among other risque programs he puts on leads his objected wife Lois to call the FCC to crack down on PTV (leading to the implication of the FCC also regulating what his family says and does).  The halftime show continued to be a subject of discussion in 2005. At the beginning of 2005, the parody newspaper The Onion ran as its headline article for January 26, 2005, """"U.S. Children Still Traumatized One Year After Seeing Partially Exposed Breast On TV"""". The article's satirical target was the nation's reaction to the incident, rather than the incident itself.[91] On February 1, 2005, exactly one year after the halftime show, the PTC released a report titled MTV Smut Peddlers: Targeting Kids with Sex, Drugs, and Alcohol, covering MTV programming during the network's """"Spring Break"""" week from March 20 to 27, 2004, accusing MTV of irresponsibly promoting sex, drugs and alcohol to impressionable youth. In response to the report, MTV network executive Jeannie Kedas argued that the report """"underestimates young people's intellect and their level of sophistication.""""[92] On February 6, however, New York Times columnist Frank Rich argued that censorship on television was becoming more prevalent following the halftime show in his February 6, 2005 column """"The Year of Living Indecently"""". Examples he cited included PBS editing obscene language out of certain programs such as the British terrorist drama Dirty War and more than 60 ABC-affiliated stations (including those owned by the Sinclair Broadcast Group, E. W. Scripps Company, Hearst-Argyle Television and Cox Broadcasting) refusing to broadcast Saving Private Ryan due to the profanity prevalent throughout the film, which was to be aired unedited in its entirety by the network. (The latter, which would later be ruled the FCC to not violate regulations, would air on cable afterwards to avoid controversy.)[93] The ESPN series Playmakers was also immediately forced to be canceled by the NFL following the incident.[94][95] A commercial from Budweiser, which depicted a man opening a beverage on the outfit's breastplate and tearing it before it was worn, was intended to be aired during Super Bowl XXXIX the following year, but was pulled before its broadcast.[96][97]  Canada [ edit ]  In Canada, where the Super Bowl telecast was broadcast by the Global Television Network, the incident passed largely without controversy: only about 50 Canadians complained about the incident to the Canadian Broadcast Standards Council (CBSC).[98] The CBSC received roughly twice as many complaints about other aspects of the Super Bowl broadcast, including music and advertising issues (though some were expected complaints about Canadian content/simsub issues preventing viewing of the popular American advertisements, which is a common issue among Canadian viewers of the Super Bowl to the present day).[99] Professor Robert Thompson, director of the Center for the Study of Popular Television at Syracuse University, stated: """"I know many people in other countries are scratching their heads and thinking 'What in the world is the big fuss over there?'""""[100]  New Zealand [ edit ]  New Zealand news outlets re-broadcast the """"nipplegate"""" moment (some in slow motion) with commentary explaining that American ultra-conservatives had made the incident into a major controversy.

Brad Pitt likes to drop by and play with her 5-year-old son Samson; wellness guru Deepak Chopra calls for advice. And Laura Day, the object of all this celebrity attention? “I’m not what you expect,” she insists. “I’m just your basic, straitlaced Jewish woman.”  Who believes—as do her fans—that she has a highly accurate sense of intuition. “Intuition allows us to predict events,” claims Day, 38. She maintains that everyone has such abilities,, waiting to be developed; her 1996 how-to book, Practical Intuition, sold 133,000 hardcover copies, and her 1997 follow-up, Practical Intuition for Success, is the first part of a two-book, $3 million deal. Before becoming an author, Day earned as much as $5,000 a session advising filmmakers (on script and casting problems) and business executives (about market trends). “I don’t see hallucinations, it’s just a flash of something in my head,” says Day, who’s wary of being thought of as some spacey psychic or guru. “I’m not magical or New Age or a spiritual leader. There’s nothing that sets me apart from anyone else.”  So how to explain all those A-list amigos? “She’s very open and loving,” says Arquette, who met Day through a mutual friend, rocker Peter Gabriel. In 1996, Arquette phoned Day to tell her that her daughter Zoe, then 2, had a fever and diarrhea, which a doctor had said was the flu. “I had a very clear feeling that Zoe was going to die,” recalls Day, who saw to it that the girl was taken to a hospital, where she was diagnosed with a rare form of blood poisoning. “Laura’s information saved Zoe’s life,” says Arquette. “It was intense.”  Day’s friendships with Hollywood heavyweights have helped her, too. When HarperCollins didn’t throw a bash for her second book last October, her friends, including close pal Brad Pitt, threw her a party instead. Demi Moore—or “Aunt Demi,” as she’s known to Samson—worked with Day on the set of 199l’s The Butcher’s Wife, in which Moore played a psychic. “Laura has given me a trust in my own intuition,” says the actress, who won’t reveal much about the business situation gone wrong but admits it would have been worse without Day’s intervention. “I took a greater position of responsibility,” says Moore. “Laura put me back in the driver’s seat.”  Day says she discovered her special way of seeing things at an early age. The oldest of four children born in New York City to David Globus, now 67 and an internist, and Vivian, a full-time mother, Day was 11 when her mother, who suffered from depression, slipped into a coma after a suicide attempt. “I wanted her to live,” says Day, “and I needed to know what to do.” She recalls having an instinct to channel her own warmth and energy into Vivian’s body. Her mother pulled through but, three years later, succeeded in taking her own life.  Day went on to study philosophy and religion at Syracuse University and, in 1979, at age 20, married Lee Day, now 39 and a Web site designer. Twelve years later they separated, and eight months after that, Day gave birth to their son Samson. Facing a mound of bills from a divorce that is still being litigated, Day, who had been teaching intuition workshops and taking a few consulting jobs, wondered how she could make ends meet and still be a full-time mother. “At the point when you’re most lost,” says Day, “that’s when intuition kicks in.”  Intuition said: Write a book. Her ensuing success—she writes two hours a day and is now working on Intuition and Love, a guide to finding a mate—allows her to “do bake sales and book sales and be a very involved parent.” A perfect evening is cooking for a gaggle of friends in her New York City loft, which she and Samson share with a cat, three lizards, a mouse and nine fish. “People are drawn to Laura,” says Adam Robinson, 42, an educator and Day’s boyfriend of three years. “She makes them feel at ease and accepted. She radiates empathy.”  And yet, Day only rarely gets intuitive about her own life, despite the success that trusting her gut has brought her. “I don’t want my environment perfect,” she says. “I work very hard to live in the moment. I’m interested in how I’m feeling right now.”  ALEX TRESNIOWSKI    DEBBIE SEAMAN in New York City""",/home/yanwang_nuist/dev_workspace/prj_python/fnd-bootstrap/dataset/gossip/Images/gossip_test/FeTRvUmKHKe3g45sieUOiHe0vreFPHLI.jpg,1.0
"""California Supreme Court Rejects 'Friends' Lawsuit, Defends Sanctity Of Writers' Room This image was lost some time after publication.  Sitcom producers all over town will be relieved to discover that the California Supreme Court upheld the no-dead-baby-rape-joke-too-foul sanctity of the writers' room today, ruling that the Friends staff was merely performing their duties when they speculated about the contents of Courteney Cox's uterus, discussed their personal views on the necessity of foreplay, or pitched out unorthodox ideas for Joey's day job:  The justices, ruling 7-0, agreed with Warner Bros. Television Productions that trash talk was part of the creative process and, therefore, the studio and its writers could not be sued for raunchy writers' meetings. The court added that no jury would believe the writers' assistant was the target of harassment during profanity-laced meetings. """"The record discloses that most of the sexually coarse and vulgar language at issue did not involve and was not aimed at plaintiff or other women in the workplace,"""" Justice Marvin Baxter wrote. [...]  Amaani Lyle, 32, alleged six years ago that raw sexual remarks peppering work sessions and conversations added up to harassment against women. Lyle said she was offended by repeated references to the actors' sex lives and to the writers' own sexual exploits as they penned the successful NBC sitcom rife with bawdy banter about six New York City friends. She was fired after four months on the job, allegedly because she could not transcribe meetings fast enough or capture the flavor of the meetings.  Perhaps the most important legal precedent set by this decision is the affirmation of a sitcom staff's ability to fire assistants over their inadequate typing/transcribing skills, the standard industry excuse used by confrontation-averse writers to terminate someone they don't like.""",/home/yanwang_nuist/dev_workspace/prj_python/fnd-bootstrap/dataset/gossip/Images/gossip_test/bppYQmn71zWKdG6GAcsBS2Hb6ef7nd1l.jpg,1.0
"""Jennifer Lopez's secret to staying youthful is a mantra embroidered on her pillowcase Jenny and her silk pillowcases.  It’s no secret that Jennifer Lopez-at 48-has a body that won’t quit and skin that needs to be studied so we can all age like the goddess she is.  Dramatic? Not even close.  And while a lot of it may be down to great genes, Lopez has revealed in a new interview some of her beauty secrets and yep, they’re as diva as you might expect.  Lopez credits her glow to positive affirmations, revealing she says one in particular to herself every day to keep her radiant, youthful look intact.  So what is this magic phrase?  “I am youthful and timeless at every age,” Lopez says every single day—but it’s not enough to just say the mantra daily, because Lopez also has a handful of pillows with these words and more mantras embroidered into them all over her home. “I tell myself that every day, a few times a day. It sounds like clichéd bullshit, but it’s not: Age is all in your mind. Look at Jane Fonda.”  Lopez continues, “The affirmations are everywhere. I forget that they’re all here. They’re just part of the house now.”  Before you scoff at Lopez’s positivity there is a school of thought that believes negative thoughts can age you. Australian-born Dr Blackburn, a Nobel Prize winner, co-authored The Telomere Effect: A Revolutionary Approach to Living Younger, Healthier, Longer, with anti-aging psychologist Dr Elissa Epel, which investigated the link between telomeres, which protect our chromosomes, and the effect stress, sleep and diet can have on telomeres and how that directly corresponds with our health.  The book asserts there is a correlation between depression and anxiety and shorter telomeres and that “when pessimists develop an aging-related illness, like cancer or heart disease, the illness tends to progress faster.”  And really there's only so far a little highlight can go, step one is all about a positive attitude. Step two is to find yourself a great pillowcase and settle on your new mantra.  So what’s the lesson here? Your inner glow is only a glass half full attitude away.""",/home/yanwang_nuist/dev_workspace/prj_python/fnd-bootstrap/dataset/gossip/Images/gossip_test/L3TAa3mLp9OybCYoZFassfqZIcQV2P0z.jpg,1.0

"""Kim Shares Throwback Photo of Kris and Caitlyn After Family Drama, Sending Fans into Overdrive Kim Kardashian West‘s latest Instagram post has fans wondering whether she’s mending fences — or throwing shade — at stepdad Caitlyn Jenner.  On Friday, the KKW Beauty mogul posted a throwback photo of Caitlyn prior to her transition in 2015. In the picture, Caitlyn — dressed in a silk robe — holds a glass of champagne while sitting on the edge of a bathtub where former wife Kris Jenner is appears to be nude and covered in bubbles.  “TGIF,” Kardashian West captioned the shot.  It didn’t take long for social media to react, many questioning why the Keeping Up with the Kardashians star was posting a picture of her estranged family member.  Image zoom Caitlyn Jenner and Kim Kardashian West  RELATED: Where Caitlyn Jenner Stands with Every Woman in the Kardashian Family  “Petty at its finest,” commented one Instagram user on her post.  Others shared the shot on Twitter, asking, “Is this Kim throwing shade at Caitlyn or is it just me?“  Perhaps one tweeter put it best: “WHAT DOES THIS MEAN!?“  Image zoom Kim Kardashian West and Caitlyn Jenner Source: Caitlyn Jenner/Instagram  It has, after all, been well over a year since Caitlyn and Kardashian West spoke.  “To be honest, I don’t talk to [the Kardashians] anymore. Kim, I haven’t talked to in a year,” Caitlyn said in November while discussing her memoir at the U.K.’s Cambridge Union, according to Cambridge News.  Although Kardashian West publicly supported Jenner’s transition, she cut ties after reading her book Secrets of My Life, which alleged Kris knew more about her gender identity crisis than she’s admitted — a claim Kris denies.  Want to keep up on the latest from PEOPLE? Sign up for our daily newsletter to get our best stories of the day delivered straight to your inbox.  In an episode of KUWTK, the KKW Beauty mogul also revealed that she had been hurt by a chapter in the memoir in which Jenner implied that her late father Robert Kardashian thought his friend O.J. Simpson was guilty of having killed wife Nicole Brown Simpson and waiter Ron Goldman — despite having served as the NFL star’s defense attorney in his 1994 murder trial.  “My relationship with Caitlyn was strained,” the mother of three said during the episode, which aired in October. “I was just trying to be respectful. But if you talk about my dad, I will cut you.”  Image zoom Caitlyn Kenner and Kim Kardashian West Source: Kim Kardashian/Instagram  Things surely couldn’t have been helped by comments Caitlyn made in January when she admitted on ITV’s Piers Morgan’s Life Stories that she “didn’t trust” the Kardashians and chose to keep the last few pages of her memoir from them when sharing advanced copies.  “I didn’t want them to leak it to the press, okay?” Jenner said, adding that those pages were the ones in which she wrote about her decision to have gender confirmation surgery to transition from male to female. “There was no reason for them to know about it.”  “I didn’t tell anybody. Why? It’s none of their business,” Jenner continued. “It’s not that big a deal.”  RELATED VIDEO: Caitlyn Jenner Reveals She Had Skin Cancer Removed from Her Nose: ‘Always Wear Your Sunblock!’  Though her relationship with step-children Kourtney Kardashian and Khloé Kardashian remains rocky, Jenner is still in daughters Kylie Jenner and Kendall Jenner’s lives. The Olympic icon even attended Kendall’s 22nd birthday bash in November at Petit Taqueria restaurant in Los Angeles, along with Kris and Kardashian West.  “Kris and Caitlyn only had a brief interaction to say hello, but everyone seemed fine,” a source told PEOPLE. “They were all focused on making it a special birthday for Kendall.”  She was also quick to celebrate the arrival of Kylie’s baby girl Stormi in February, sharing a throwback photo of her 20-year-old daughter on Instagram. “My daughter just had a daughter,” Caitlyn wrote in the photo’s caption. “It’s amazing to be by your side through this journey. She’s SO beautiful already. Can’t wait to watch her grow. Throwback to my baby, as a baby @kyliejenner.”  And despite their estrangement, in April 2017, Kardashian West told Ellen Degeneres that she would “always love her” for helping raise her and her sisters.""",/home/yanwang_nuist/dev_workspace/prj_python/fnd-bootstrap/dataset/gossip/Images/gossip_test/cZjQrQmPOuV2XFqrWrpapNRlyI6KGNLP.jpg,1.0
"""The Evolution of Cameron Diaz's Career From 'The Mask' to 'The Other Woman' With no major awards to her name (yet) and a career that's sometimes been overshadowed by her off-screen romances or her headline-grabbing quotes, it's unfortunately too easy to brush aside Cameron Diaz's impressive, long-lasting, and unique resume in Hollywood. At 41-years-old, and exactly 20 years since she burst on to the scene in the smash comedy The Mask, Diaz is still sitting pretty on the A-list. This year alone she has three major projects on her docket: two comedies, including The Other Woman and Sex Tape, as well as the remake of the musical Annie.  The model-turned-actress has a career that has exceeded many expectations, one that has included multi-million dollar franchises (Shrek, Charlie's Angels), critically-praised performances (Being John Malkovich, In Her Shoes), raunchy comedy hits (There's Something About Mary, Bad Teacher), eye-raising indies (Vanilla Sky, The Counselor), mainstream rom-coms (My Best Friend's Wedding, What To Expect When You're Expecting), and even a Best Picture nominee (The Gangs of New York). While there have been, of course, some misfires (The Box, Knight and Day, among others), Diaz has kept things interesting, not only for herself, but for audiences and critics alike.  In anticipation The Other Woman, the comedy which Diaz stars alongside with Leslie Mann and Kate Upton and opens in theaters this Thursday, we look back at the evolution of her screen career.  1994 - 1999: A Star is Born  In 1994, it was all about Jim Carrey. The guy was everywhere. But leave it to Cameron Diaz to upstage him at the absolute height of his fame. Diaz skyrocketed to breakout star status when she played Carrey's va-va-voom love interest in the manic comedy The Mask. The movie, which went on to earn $119 million at the box office, launched Diaz's career and made her a household name in the '90s. While Diaz mostly played sidekicks or love interests, sometimes with good results (My Best Friend's Wedding), but mostly with not-so-good results (Very Bad Things, Feeling Minnesota, A Life Less Ordinary) none of that mattered by 1998. Because thanks to one shocking hairdo in one seriously un-PC, but hilarious Farrelly Brothers comedy, everyone knew Diaz could hold her own.  Diaz played the titular, fawned-over Mary in There's Something About Mary, an R-rated comedy that would earn $176 million at the box office and proved that the fearless Diaz was just as funny, if not funnier, than the guys dominating the comedy scene in the '90s like Ben Stiller. But Diaz's most daring transformation happened in 1999 when she played the frizzy, frazzled Lotte in the Oscar-nominated mind-bender Being John Malkovich.  While she was a natural at comedy, it was Spike Jonze that opened a new portal to Diaz's talents beyond being goofy and giggly. As Roger Ebert marveled in his glowing review of the film, """"Cameron Diaz, one of the best-looking women in movies, who here looks so dowdy we hardly recognize her; Diaz has fun with her talent by taking it incognito to strange places and making it work for a living."""" (Diaz earned Golden Globe nominations for her performances in both Being John Malkovich and There's Something About Mary.)  2000 - 2005: The Really Big Time  The early 2000s were, without question, the most successful of Diaz's career. In 2000 the big screen Charlie's Angels reboot was a girl power powerhouse that spawned a 2003 sequel that brought in a combined $350 million in the U.S. alone. Diaz also lent her voice as Princess Fiona to the animated juggernaut that was the Shrek saga. The original Shrek was released in 2000, won an Oscar, and had three follow-ups (2004's Shrek 2, 2007's Shrek the Third, and 2010's Shrek Forever After) which comined all totaled over $1 billion in box office receipts.  In addition to her blockbusters, Diaz teamed up with acclaimed directors Cameron Crowe and Martin Scorsese to mixed results with 2001's Vanilla Sky (audiences didn't warm to it, but it earned Diaz her third Globe nomination) and 2002's Gangs of New York (a hit that earned Diaz her fourth-career Globe nod), respectively. The actress also tried to recreate the gross-out magic of There's Something About Mary, but failed to do so with 2002's critically panned The Sweetest Thing. She fared far better when she appeared alongside Toni Collette in the 2005 family dramedy In Her Shoes, a movie that showed some of Diaz's best acting and range to date.  2006 - 2010: A Rough Patch  While 2006's sugary ensemble rom-com The Holiday was a moderate hit ($63 million), what followed wasn't so sweet. Diaz starred in a series of flicks that both audiences and critics turned away from, including the mind-numbing 2008 comedy What Happens in Vegas, the emotionally manipulative 2009 drama My Sister's Keeper, 2009's so-laughably-bad-it's-bad thriller The Box, and 2010's Tom Cruise reunion gone awry Knight and Day. Hey, ya can't win 'em all.  2011 - Current: Back in the Groove?  Okay, so 2011's The Green Hornet sucked, but that was through no fault of Diaz's own. Plus, she bounced back rather nicely later that year with the comedy Bad Teacher, a movie she carried all the past the $100 million mark at the box office. While 2012 and 2013 brought Diaz two of the worst-reviewed movies of her career, Gambit (a mere 19 percent on Rotten Tomatoes) and the polarizing The Counselor (all anyone could really talk about was that car scene), 2014 looks to be one of the star's most noteworthy years in quite some time with the triple threat of The Other Woman, Sex Tape, and Annie.

Jones has been a featured performer at the Just for Laughs festival in Montreal and the Aspen Comedy Festival. In 2010, her one-hour comedy special, Problem Child, was broadcast on Showtime. Jones starred in Ghostbusters (2016) as Patty Tolan. In 2017 and 2018, Jones was nominated for an Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series for her work on Saturday Night Live.  Early life [ edit ]  Annette Jones was born on September 7, 1967, in Memphis, Tennessee.[3] Her father was in the United States Army, and her family moved frequently.[4] Her family moved to Los Angeles, when her father took a job at Stevie Wonder's radio station, KJLH, as an electronics engineer.[3] Jones attended high school in Lynwood, California, where she also played basketball; her father suggested that she play the sport because she is six feet tall.[5]  Jones attended Chapman University on a basketball scholarship and transferred to Colorado State University when her coach Brian Berger left Chapman for Colorado State.[1][6][7] She intended to become a lawyer,[8] but changed her mind and changed her major a few times, including to business accounting and computer science and eventually ended up majoring in communications.[9] At Chapman, Jones became a radio DJ.[9] She was unsure of what she wanted to do and contemplated the possibility of a career playing basketball overseas.[8]  She had a brother, Rodney Keith Jones (1971-2009).[citation needed][10]  Career [ edit ]  Jones started to do stand-up comedy in college in 1987, when a friend signed her up for a """"Funniest Person on Campus"""" contest.[8][4] After she won the contest, Jones left school and moved to Los Angeles.[8] She performed at regular clubs and worked at Roscoe's House of Chicken and Waffles and UPS[11] to make ends meet. Mother Love and Dave Chappelle encouraged her to move to New York City to hone her craft for two years, where she appeared on BET's ComicView before returning to Los Angeles.[9] She performed at The Comedy Store in West Hollywood, but received unfavorable reviews.[9] She opened up for Jamie Foxx and was booed by the audience. Feeling discouraged, Jones stopped performing for three years.[9]  In 2008, Jones was part of Katt Williams's It's Pimpin' Pimpin' tour.[4][12]  Saturday Night Live [ edit ]  In December 2013, Saturday Night Live held a casting call to add at least one African-American woman to the show, and Jones auditioned. Prior to being asked to audition, Jones had criticized the show, saying that the show, and especially cast member Kenan Thompson, was """"not funny"""".[13] Sasheer Zamata was added as a featured player, while Jones and LaKendra Tookes were hired as writers.[14] Jones appeared during the Weekend Update segment of the May 3, 2014 episode hosted by Andrew Garfield, where her jokes about her current dating problems and her potential effectiveness as a breeding slave were met with controversy.[6][15]  Jones appeared in the first and third episodes of the 40th season, hosted by Chris Pratt and Bill Hader, respectively. On October 20, 2014, Jones was promoted to the cast as a featured player, and made her official debut on the October 25, 2014 episode hosted by Jim Carrey. She became, at the age of 47, the oldest person to join the show as a cast member (surpassing Michael McKean and George Coe, who were 46 when they joined the show in, respectively, 1994 and 1975).[16][17] Jones's addition marks the first time in SNL history that the show's cast has included more than one African-American woman; in addition, the 40th season had the most African-American cast members to date.[18] Jones subsequently returned for Seasons 41, 42, 43, and 44.  In 2017 and 2018, Jones was nominated for an Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series for her work on SNL.  Film [ edit ]  In 2006, Jones appeared in Master P's movie Repos.  In 2014, Jones appeared in Chris Rock's directing debut, Top Five; Rock has said a follow-up is in the works,[19] telling Complex Magazine, """"Some people really shine in Top Five. You might want to see a little more Leslie Jones.""""[20]  In 2015, Jones appeared in the Judd Apatow and Amy Schumer project, Trainwreck; reportedly Apatow and Schumer wrote a part specifically for Jones after seeing her turn in Top Five.[21]  In 2016, she starred in the reboot Ghostbusters as Patty Tolan, alongside Melissa McCarthy, Kristen Wiig, and Kate McKinnon.[6][22]  Olympics [ edit ]  During the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio, Jones[23] regularly live-tweeted events and posted videos of her reactions.[24] Enthusiasm for Jones's commentary grew, with articles appearing like The Huffington Post's """"Watching Leslie Jones Watch The Olympics Is Better Than The Actual Olympics"""".[25] Television producer Mike Shoemaker, one of Jones's Twitter followers, posted on Twitter that his friend Jim Bell, NBC's executive producer of the network's Olympics coverage, should add Jones to NBC's team of commentators covering the Games; Bell responded on Twitter the next day asking Jones to join NBC in Rio. She accepted and flew to Rio, covering swimming, track and field, gymnastics, and beach volleyball for NBC.[26]  Jones reprised her duties at the 2018 Winter Olympics.[27]  Other projects [ edit ]  Jones and fellow comedian Adam DeVine appeared in a 2016 ad campaign for Allstate Insurance, created by Leo Burnett Worldwide.[28]  Jones hosted the BET Awards on June 25, 2017.[29] This marked her hosting debut.  In 2018, Jones appeared in two advertisements for Amazon's Echo Spot.[30]  Sports fandom [ edit ]  Jones is a fan of the MLS team Seattle Sounders FC.[31]  Influences [ edit ]  Jones has cited as her comedic influences Eddie Murphy,[8] Richard Pryor,[4] Carol Burnett[32], Lucille Ball[32], John Ritter,[32] and Whoopi Goldberg.[4]  Online attacks [ edit ]  Following the release of Ghostbusters, Jones became the target of numerous accounts on social networking site Twitter making racist attacks. Twitter responded by taking action against several users, resulting in the permanent Twitter suspension of user and Breitbart editor Milo Yiannopoulos, who had described her as """"barely literate"""".[33]  After continuing to receive racial comments towards her, Jones left Twitter on July 18, 2016.[34] Jones appeared later in the week on Late Night with Seth Meyers, in which she described the ordeal and her meeting with Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey. Responding to Yiannopoulos's claim that he was targeted for being a """"gay conservative"""", Jones stated, """"Free speech and hate speech [are] two different things"""".[35]  Nearly a month later, Jones was again the subject of numerous online attacks. Her personal website was hacked, with its contents being replaced by photos of her driver's license and passport.[36] The site was also made to display alleged nude photographs of Jones, as well as a video tribute to Harambe, the Cincinnati Zoo gorilla killed in May 2016 (a reference to the racially charged gorilla remarks directed at Jones in the earlier attack). Jones's team took the website down shortly after it was hacked.[37]  Both incidents resulted in large outpourings of celebrity and fan support, via the hashtag """"#LoveForLeslieJ"""", which trended on both Twitter and Instagram.[38] Paul Feig,[39] Gabourey Sidibe, Ellen DeGeneres, Sara Benincasa, Ava DuVernay, Hillary Clinton, Corey Taylor,[40] Katy Perry, Octavia Spencer, Anna Kendrick, Lena Dunham[41] and Loni Love expressed solidarity with Jones. Jones responded to the hacks on the October 22, 2016, episode of Saturday Night Live.[42]  Filmography [ edit ]  Film [ edit ]  Television [ edit ]""",/home/yanwang_nuist/dev_workspace/prj_python/fnd-bootstrap/dataset/gossip/Images/gossip_test/M8sdBl6S8DQbi1ehRrgX7iX2I4q9AU0b.jpg,1.0
"""Review: Dwayne Johnson's bland 'Baywatch' can't commit to the absurd CLOSE The Rock, Zac Efron and Priyanka Chopra pick up where David Hasselhoff and Pamela Anderson left off as they try to rejuvenate the lifeguard program amid budget cuts. Paramount Pictures  Dwayne Johnson, left, and Zac Efron are hard-bodied lifesavers in the comedy 'Baywatch.' (Photo: Frank Masi)  The big-screen version of Baywatch peaks early with its silliness right in the opening credits: A stern-looking Dwayne Johnson saves someone while dolphins high five each other with flippers and a title treatment hovers heroically in Godzilla-sized type.  Unfortunately, nothing after that is as lovably ridiculous in this new paean to the 1990s Z-grade TV hit with David Hasselhoff and Pamela Anderson. This Baywatch (** out of four; rated R; in theaters nationwide Thursday night) has its share of hilarious moments but never fully commits to the absurd, and even the cleverest jokes get so many callbacks, they’re beating a dead seahorse.  The comedy directed by Seth Gordon (Horrible Bosses) rests on the boulder shoulders of The Rock, who plays the old Hoff role of Baywatch honcho Mitch Buchannon. Instead of just giving out random suntan-lotion rubdowns and helping the occasional victim of a bad wave, these lifeguards are part-time superheroes who take on fiery boat accidents, jewelry-stealing grifters and rampant drug dealing along their beloved Emerald Bay. When a passerby asks Mitch if he’s Batman, our hero responds, “Sure, pal. Just bigger. And browner.”  The archetypal Baywatch crew — including second-in-command Stephanie (Ilfenesh Hadera), athletic Summer (Alexandra Daddario), good-hearted CJ (Kelly Rohrbach) and nerdy Ronnie (Jon Bass) — have a difficult time getting on the same page with the addition of new recruit Matt Brody (Zac Efron), a disgraced Olympic swimming champion hired to the team as a PR stunt. Mitch and Brody clash often, trash-talking each other endlessly and engaging in physical competitions (like hauling fridges), but have to put their macho egos in check to stop local businesswoman Victoria Leeds (Priyanka Chopra) and the femme fatale’s nefarious plans to take over the bay.  Priyanka Chopra stars as villainess Victoria Leeds in 'Baywatch.' (Photo: Frank Masi)  Brandishing bods that’ll make you question your own fitness decisions, Johnson and Efron are at least fun to watch — Mitch reads as a little too serious, though Brody makes up for it as an overly self-confident goof who spends much of the movie wondering why they just don’t call the cops. Daddario adds a surprising deft comedic touch as well: A scene where Mitch, Brody and Summer investigate the morgue Scooby-Doo style is one of the few times when Baywatch really shines.  Everything one would expect in a Baywatch movie — cleavage, bouncing body parts, constant flexing and the excessive use of slo-mo — is present. (Plus, a couple of the old TV cast members show up for cameos.) Yet the remake yearns to be both sendup farce and straight action film, tripping along the way and failing to grasp either. When the plastic aquarium version of the usually ultra-charismatic Johnson gets more laughs than the real deal, there’s something seriously wrong.  A lot of the humor just doesn’t connect and tries way too hard, from one dude getting his junk stuck in a beach chair to a running gag involving salad. Chopra, whose villainess seems bored by the whole situation, would rather be eviling it up in a James Bond movie, and the fireworks-laden climax is full of punch but leans predictable and lacks excitement.  This flick might be bigger than the original Baywatch — from the production budget to its stars' muscles — but lacks the cheesy fun.

"""Meghan Markle’s dad Thomas causing royal family problems The newly wedded Duchess of Sussex Meghan has joined Her Royal Highness Queen Elizabeth II at a series of events as she launched into life as a full-time royal.  ROYAL aides are said to be concerned over the public outbursts of Meghan Markle’s dad, following a number of explosive TV interviews in recent months.  According to the Mirror in the UK, aides at the Palace have held at least three top-level crisis meetings on how to stop Thomas Markle upsetting his daughter.  It comes after the 74-year-old claimed the Duchess is “terrified” of her new royal role and, royal insiders say, “crossed the line” with his comments that Princess Diana would have “loathed” how he had been frozen out of the royal circle, reports The Sun.  The Mirror also claims that the matter has gotten so out of hand that royal sources say the only way to end the farce will be for the Queen to step in.  Sources suggest the talks have centred around three potential options to bring the situation to a close.  The first would be for Meghan to talk directly to her father via a phone call in a personal appeal for him to stop, and a second could be to arrange an intermediary meeting to appeal to him face-to-face.  A final scenario would be to cut him off, the Mirror has claimed.  Kensington Palace declined to comment on the claims.  The Daily Mail reported an unnamed friend of Meghan’s saying that a reconciliation is completely off the table.  “There’s no chance right now - he’s been a complete embarrassment,” the source said.  MORE: Thomas Markle speaks about former drug use.  MORE: Meghan’s kids will have surprising surname  The Palace crisis talks come just days after the Duchess’ dad confessed to taking drugs while his daughter Meghan was growing up.  Meghan’s outspoken father made the startling admission as he angrily denied having a drinking problem.  He said: “I don’t do drugs, haven’t for more than 20 years” while claiming he only has wine with dinner.  Mr Markle insisted that he doesn’t even drink beer despite being photographed with a six pack.  He said: “I regularly buy a six-pack for the guys on the guard gate because they’re stuck in a hot shack for hours each day and could use a cold one.”  A source close to the family added that Mr Markle used drugs to cope with the pressures of Hollywood while working as a lighting director.  They said that drug use was “part and parcel” of working in television where the hours were long.  While Mr Markle did not specify which drugs he used to take, his daughter Samantha said that marijuana was popular among his peers at the time.

Speaking to Jake Gyllenhaal about his love affair with Taylor Swift on Wednesday, the shock jock said he wanted the actor to take it all the way to the altar.  Speaking on his Sirius XM show Howard told Jake: ‘I feel—and this is me stepping in—you should have married Taylor Swift, and I'll tell you why…What a power couple!’  Scroll down for video  Third degree: Jake Gyllenhaal was quizzed on his romance with Taylor Swift on Wednesday when he made an appearance on the Howard Stern XFM show  The Southpaw actor, 34, responded: ‘Oh, that's the reason?’  Howard, 61, who was now in his stride, revealed he was ‘super attracted’ to Taylor and said if he had been friends with Jake when they were dating, he would have told him she was worth staying with long term.  The Nightcrawler star, who dated the ‘Shake It Off’ singer for three months back in 2010 admitted: ‘She’s a beautiful girl.’  Romance: He dated the singer for three months in 2010  Jake joked: ‘Why didn't you have me on this show sooner?’  Howard, warming to his topic continued: ‘I would have said, “Jake, this is The One.”  ‘Because to me, nothing is sexier than a woman who can play songs and write.’  Robin Quivers who co-hosts with Howard then brought up Taylor had written a song about her relationship with Jake – their break up is said to have inspired tracks on the Red album.  To the altar: Howard pressed the actor for details and then said he thought they should have got hitched  Jake, feigning ignorance said: ‘Do I?’  Howard chimed in asking which one it was.  The actor replied: ‘I don't know...This is all Robin. She's looking it up right now. She's feverishly looking it up online.’  Howard then asked Jake if he was in love at the moment, who responded he wasn’t.  When asked if he was upset about it, Jake replied: ‘Yeah. I love love, man. Are you kidding me?’  Howard then asked: ‘How many times in your life have you really been in love—really in love?’  Jake answered: ‘Three times but didn’t name any names. He then added: ‘Twice.’  Big love: Jake was asked if he had ever been in love - he said twice. It is thought he was referring to his relationship with Kirsten Dunst - they are pictured here at the American Museum of Natural History in New York in 2004  It is thought he may have been referring to his relationship with Kirsten Dunst, whom he dated from 2002 to 2004, and also Reese Witherspoon, whom he was with for three years from 2007 to 2009.  When asked if something held him back from getting married he revealed it was him and said: ‘I think I probably just got scared.’  However he also said: 'There are a lot of beautiful women, there are opportunities, but I think at the same time, if you find the right person, I believe in monogamy I believe in when you meet somebody who is right it will be right and you will stay there.'  Happy: It thought he was also referring to Reese Witherspoon, whom he was with for three years from 2007 to 2009  Howard also addressed Jakes appearance on Good Morning America on Tuesday, where Taylor’s song Bad Blood played in the background as the actor was being interviewed.  It became an issue on social media as it was thought the show may have been attempting to make an association between the pair.  Jake reiterated he was unaware of the music, saying: ‘First of all, I did not hear that...When I'm doing an interview when you're up at 5 a.m. and you can't really make sense of words, you're not thinking about the background music that's playing behind you.’  Oops! The star was also asked about his appearance on Good Morning America on Tuesday, where they played a Taylor Swift song when he came on set  ‘So they aren't they sabotaging you in a sense?’ Howard asked.  ‘Oh, please!’ the actor retorted. ‘Good Morning America?’  When asked if he would have recognised it was a song by Taylor Jake said adamantly he would.  Howard pressed on: ‘You are not defined by dating Taylor Swift. But they are defining you with a Taylor Swift song.’  Jake joked: ‘There are dark things that happen on Good Morning America. That is not one of them.’""",/home/yanwang_nuist/dev_workspace/prj_python/fnd-bootstrap/dataset/gossip/Images/gossip_test/9wj7angN22ktPivH3PdOMfjS63jZbggh.jpg,1.0
"""Nicole Kidman and Keith Urban take PDA to a new level on Cannes red carpet Cute or a bit too much? Nicole Kidman and Keith Urban weren't shy about showing affection on the red carpet at Cannes.  The Nic-aissance has officially hit Cannes, with Nicole Kidman promoting no fewer than four movies at the film festival this year.  The actress understands that the notorious press calls, complete with wall-to-wall photographers, on those red carpet steps, are the most important aspect of a movie's promotion.  Where else but in Cannes do we witness the perfect melange of decadence, frivolity and just a splash of tacky? Not even The Met Ball can guarantee this level of fashion extra-ness.  Andreas Rentz The couple starts with some hand-holding...  This goes some way to explaining the piece of performance art produced by Kidman and her husband, Keith Urban, at the premiere of The Killing of a Scared Deer.  READ MORE:  * Naomie Harris barefoot in Cannes is all of us after a big night out  * Sofia Coppola and Nicole Kidman lead Cannes Film Festival 2017 lineup  * Best & worst dressed: 2016 Cannes Film Festival so far  JEAN-PAUL PELISSIER And some hand-kissing...  The nuzzles, the elongated looks, the soft nibbles on the neck, the fingers, entwined in climactic pleasure, all combine to create what might best be titled """"Le Public de Love Making"""", which is probably the grossest sentence ever written, but if the oversized tutu fits ...  At one point, Urban took hold of his wife's long hair and gently pulled at it while gripping her bare back, in what might be described as a classic Mills and Boon cover move.  It isn't the first time the couple have put their PDA on display. It's actually something of a sensuous habit. At this year's Oscars, Kidman and Urban engaged in the sort of kissing normally reserved for couples bidding farewell at the airport… in a private room… on a military base.  ERIC GAILLARD There's also a bit of eye-gazing...  When Kidman is able to come up for air, she tends to look a little coy. This moment is usually alleviated by Urban through prolonged eye contact followed by a """"presentation"""" of his wife to photographers.  If the move seems familiar, it's because it is.  In 1992, when Kidman made her debut at Cannes, she arrived with her then husband, Tom Cruise, a man who is not shy of presenting wives and belief-defying displays of public affection.  ERIC GAILLARD There's even a few tears.  All of which begs, was it Tom who influenced Nicole, or the other way around? Kidman, who has admitted to social introversion, has said several times that she finds the red carpet nerve-wracking, and to ease her butterflies, she goes into her own private world.  This admission makes sense – it's not performance PDA then, but an attempt to cope with the onslaught of cameras.  It also explains why she also held hands with, and leaned on Colin Farrell at the premiere, too. Although, considering Farrell has lost none of his own scrappy brand of Celtic sensuality, there's really no explanation required.""",/home/yanwang_nuist/dev_workspace/prj_python/fnd-bootstrap/dataset/gossip/Images/gossip_test/BIN8v6rv3aP0L5L52T3YS1CmVP9Ptakh.jpg,1.0

""""Scott and Sofia flew in on Monday evening on a private jet to Cabo with his kids and another couple.""""  You might wonder why someone would leave Southern California to go on vacation. Well, it's more than 10 degrees warmer in Cabo than in Calabasas right now. And to L.A. folks, weather in the 60s is """"cold.""""  It sounds like they've all been soaking up the sun and generally enjoying the lifestyle of the idle rich.  """"They've been spending their days by the pool relaxing and enjoying the warm weather.""""  And we're not just talking about Scott and Sofia. Mason, Penelope, and Reign are all having a blast, too.  """"Scott's kids have stayed busy with lots of swimming and playing in the water.""""  But looking after the kids hasn't thrown a wet blanket over their romance.  """"Scott and Sofia are inseparable and seem happy.""""  The source continues, talking about the lovey-dovey relationship between Scott and his teenage girlfriend.  """"They were posing for pictures together and kissing every chance they got.""""  Scott and Sofia also have a puppy, and they brought their precious little love with them.  """"They are both obsessed with the puppy and giving it lots of love.""""  Apparently, Scott is mostly doing this for Sofia.  """"Scott promised Sofia a trip and thought it would be nice for them to get away.""""  In many ways, this trip is a couple's retreat with activities planned just for the two of them.  HollywoodLife reports that Scott is deliberately antagonizing Kourtney by bringing his kids on a """"family vacation"""" with Sofia.  """"Scott is well aware that bringing Sofia on his trip to Mexico with the kids has pissed off Kourtney.""""  So ... why would he do such a thing?  """"That was the whole point.""""  Oh.  """"He’s been taunting Kourtney with pictures of Sofia and the kids bonding.""""  That seems outrageously cruel, if true.  """"He’s clearly doing it to upset her.""""  And, according to this report, Scott's bad behavior is getting even worse.  """"But what’s even more twisted is that he’s been telling their mutual friends that Sofia is better with the kids than Kourtney is.""""  This is just sickening to hear.  """"Scott claims they like Sofia more than Kourtney.""""  And all of these messages are apparently designed to taunt and antagonize Kourtney.  """"Scott knows it’s going to get straight back to Kourtney and mess with her head.""""  He spent a great deal of 2017 doing what many perceived as """"acting out"""" to get back at Kourtney for moving on with her life. But this is worse.  """"It’s a new low, even for him.""""  One can only imagine how hurt and distressed Kourtney must be.  It's not that she's possessive of Scott, it's that it must be distressing to hear about the father of her children acting like that. It must be breaking her heart.  However, at least on the outside, Kourtney is enjoying her child-free time with a sexy vacation with boy-toy turned boyfriend Younes Bendjima.  This dreamy couple has spent the last few days on a trip up the California coast.  It's possible that Scott really is trying to wound Kourtney's pride but, if so, it sounds like he's only making an ass of himself.""",/home/yanwang_nuist/dev_workspace/prj_python/fnd-bootstrap/dataset/gossip/Images/gossip_test/p3JifP9wtZ23CfKvscu6G6NoNT6wPUvy.jpg,0.0
"""Beyonce and Jay Z Welcome Twins (Report) – Variety Beyoncé Knowles and Jay Z have welcomed twins, according to Roger Friedman’s ShowBiz 411.  It is unknown precisely when the singer gave birth, though it stands to reason that it would have been on or around June 15, as Jay Z was due to be honored that night in New York City at the Songwriters Hall of Fame, but did not attend the ceremony.  The sex of the twins is also unknown, but former U.S. President Barack Obama hinted at the arrival of two girls in a video message broadcast at the Songwriters Hall of Fame. They’ll join big sister Blue Ivy Carter, born in January 2012.  Beyoncé announced her pregnancy via Instagram on February 1. The post — showing the singer embracing her baby bump in a garden scene — broke records on the social media platform. The post currently has nearly 11 million likes.  She performed at the Grammys later that month in a visual spectacle that included holographic technology. During the show, she took home trophies for Best Urban Contemporary Album (for “Lemonade”) and Best Music Video (for “Formation”). Despite having the most nominations, she got shut out in the top four categories to Adele.  Beyoncé has kept a low profile in recent months, dropping out of Coachella (she was replaced by Lady Gaga) in April and skipping the Met Gala in May.  The Carter family is reportedly looking at properties in Los Angeles, having made a $120 million offer on a brand new Bel-Air property designed by architect Paul McClean.  Reps for the couple have not responded to requests for comment.  Update: Mathew Knowles, Beyonce Knowles’ father, tweeted an announcement of the twins’ arrival on June 18 (Father’s Day).""",/home/yanwang_nuist/dev_workspace/prj_python/fnd-bootstrap/dataset/gossip/Images/gossip_test/qLAI4V5yY4jKgtIcm3z0p5mMub0pOk7b.jpg,1.0
"""The alleged reason behind Chris Pratt and Anna Faris' devastating divorce can teach couples a big lesson Anna Faris and Chris Pratt. John Shearer/Invision/AP  The INSIDER Summary:  Anna Faris and Chris Pratt announced their separation earlier this year and filed for divorce this week.  People have been speculating as to why.  A report claims that the pair split because of different views on the type of family they wanted.  While we can't confirm the report, this is a hurdle most couples will face at some point.  Our collective hearts broke when the news came out that Chris Pratt and Anna Faris were separating after eight years of marriage — and even further when they officially filed for divorce. Since fans felt like they knew the pair personally, people quickly scrambled to figure out the reason for the split.  Soon after they announced their break up, people on social media began speculating that Pratt had been unfaithful to Faris with co-star Jennifer Lawrence, something that the two had denied fervently in the past.  After that, TMZ interviewed a source that said the real reason for the split was far less dramatic: Faris simply wanted a more """"traditional"""" family that was in the same place at the same time. Pratt, with his burgeoning movie career, was often away and it put a strain on the couple's marriage.  Now, it goes without saying that this report should be taken with a grain of salt since it's based on an anonymous source and the real reason will only be confirmed if it comes from Faris and Pratt themselves. But it's not hard to believe that this could very well be the reason — or at least part of the reason — for their separation, as it's something nearly every couple goes through. And it's something everyone can learn a lesson from.  Have an in-depth conversation and have it often.  When a relationship hits a serious stage and couples get married or commit to each other in some big way, people are often too overcome with excitement or too overwhelmed by the prospect of spending forever with this person to have a deep discussion about where their priorities lie.  Most couples will have your standard conversation: Do you want kids? How many? Where do you want to live? What are your career goals? But real commitment requires an even deeper dive with even deeper questions: How do you each feel about taking care of aging parents? What will you do if one of you is laid off? What will you do if either of your careers goes better or worse than expected?  """"Making major life decisions or wants with your partner in the dark or assuming that they know what you want and what your goals all, removes the opportunity for discussion, compromise, and support,"""" therapist Stacey Ojeda told INSIDER. """"We have to give our partners the opportunity to help us meet our goals and needs to have a healthy relationship.""""  Even the most well-matched couples are going to have different views on important topics throughout their time together.  Couples can help avoid confusion by having an open dialogue from the beginning of their relationship.  Make sure, even within the first month of dating someone, that you casually learn more about them and what they find most important. That sets a precedent for a relationship that allows you both to open up about your hard and fast goals — both now and in the future.  People's priorities change, even in a committed relationship. Pixabay/MadalinIonut  """"Disclosure from the beginning can save people time and heartache,"""" April Davis, a relationship expert and CEO of LUMA-Luxury Matchmaking, told INSIDER. """"When you are starting to get serious your partner share your hard-lined must-haves and have-nots. If you know that you wish to be a homeowner, parent, or living abroad in the next five years let them know.""""  Accept that people change, but keep your partner in mind.  People still grow and change while married or committed to someone. The result is, often, the person we commit to isn't always the person we're with 5, 10, or 20 years down the line.  Recognizing that people can change and be having constant conversations about priorities is a habit that all couples can benefit from. It's important when making new and exciting decisions that you include your partner in that vision of your future.  """"The biggest mistake is sharing without making their partner feel like their apart of the vision,"""" counselor Shuntai Walker told INSIDER. """"It's important to include and not exclude your loved one. Even if it's just for moral support.""""  Sometimes change can't be avoided.  These types of conversations about priorities and the future are important, but that's not to say that Faris and Pratt broke up because they didn't have these conversations. Sometimes even couples who talk about this frequently can experience changes, like Pratt's sudden box office success or the tabloid rumors of infidelity that Faris openly said made her feel lonely and insecure.  Very often, a change in perspective or priorities cannot be avoided and the marriage has to end. But keeping an open dialogue will help you identify when things aren't working out for you and your partner, and how to best shift focus to improve your relationship, movie stars or not.

"""Natalie Wood American actress  Natalie Wood (born Natalia Nikolaevna Zakharenko; July 20, 1938 – November 29, 1981) was an American actress.  Born in San Francisco to Russian immigrant parents, Wood began her career in film as a child and became a successful Hollywood star as a young adult, receiving three Academy Award nominations before she turned 25 years of age. She began acting in films at the age of four and, at age eight, was given a co-starring role in Miracle on 34th Street (1947).[2] As a teenager, she earned a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her performance in Rebel Without a Cause (1955). She starred in the musical films West Side Story (1961) and Gypsy (1962), and received nominations for the Academy Award for Best Actress for her performances in Splendor in the Grass (1961) and Love with the Proper Stranger (1963). Her career continued with films such as Sex and the Single Girl (1964), Inside Daisy Clover (1964), and Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice (1969).  During the 1970s, Wood began a hiatus from film and had two children with husband Robert Wagner, whom she married twice. She appeared in only three films throughout the decade, but did act in several television productions; her television work including a remake of the film From Here to Eternity (1979) for which she received a Golden Globe Award. Wood's films represented a """"coming of age"""" for her and Hollywood films in general.[3] Critics and scholars have suggested that Wood's cinematic career, one of the few to include both child roles and roles playing middle-aged characters, represents a portrait of modern American womanhood in transition.[4][5]  Wood drowned on November 29, 1981, at the age of 43. The events surrounding her death have been controversial due to conflicting witness statements,[6] prompting the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department in 2012 to list her cause of death as """"drowning and other undetermined factors"""".[7][8]  Early life [ edit ]  Natalie Wood was born Natalia Nikolaevna Zakharenko[10][11] in San Francisco, California, the daughter of Russian immigrant parents Nikolai Stepanovich Zakharenko (1912–1980) and Maria Stepanovna Zakharenko (née Zudilova; 1912–1996). Her father was born in Vladivostok into a poor family of Stepan Zakharenko, a chocolate factory worker who joined the anti-Bolshevik civilian forces during the Russian Civil War.[12] Her grandfather was killed in 1918 in a street fight between Red and White Russian soldiers. After that, his wife and her three sons fled to their relatives in Montreal. Later, they moved to San Francisco, where Nikolai worked as a day laborer and carpenter.  Natalia's mother was born in Barnaul. Her father Stepan Zudilov owned soap and candle factories, as well as an estate outside the city.[12] With the start of the civil war, his family left Russia, resettling as refugees in the Chinese city of Harbin. Maria married Alexander Tatuloff in China and had a daughter, Olga (1927–2015).[18] Natalie liked to describe her family as having been either gypsies or landowning aristocrats in Russia. In her youth, her mother had dreamed of becoming an actress or ballet dancer. Natalie and her sisters were raised Russian Orthodox and remained in the church.[citation needed] As an adult, she stated, """"I'm very Russian, you know."""" She spoke both English and Russian with an American accent.  Biographer Warren Harris wrote that under the family's """"needy circumstances"""", her mother may have transferred her ambitions to her middle daughter, Natalia. Her mother would take Natalia to the movies as often as she could: """"Natalie's only professional training was watching Hollywood child stars from her mother's lap,"""" notes Harris. Wood would later recall this time, """"My mother used to tell me that the cameraman who pointed his lens out at the audience at the end of the Paramount newsreel was taking my picture. I'd pose and smile like he was going to make me famous or something. I believed everything my mother told me.""""  Shortly after Natalia was born in San Francisco, her family moved to Santa Rosa. Natalia (often called """"Natasha"""", the Russian diminutive) was noticed by members of a crew during a film shoot in downtown Santa Rosa. Her mother soon moved the family to Los Angeles in order to pursue a film career for her daughter. After Natalia started acting as a child, David Lewis and William Goetz, studio executives at RKO Radio Pictures, changed her name to """"Natalie Wood"""".  Wood's younger sister, Svetlana Gurdin (the family had changed their surname), was born in Santa Monica after the move. Now known as Lana Wood, she also became an actress.  Career [ edit ]  Child actress [ edit ]  Miracle on 34th Street, 1947 Wood as Susan Walker in, 1947  A few weeks before her fifth birthday, Wood made her film debut as a character actress in a fifteen-second scene in the 1943 film Happy Land. Despite the brief part, she attracted the notice of the director, Irving Pichel. He remained in contact with Wood's family for two years, advising them when another role came up. The director telephoned Wood's mother and asked her to bring her daughter to Los Angeles for a screen test. Wood's mother became so excited that she """"packed the whole family off to Los Angeles to live,"""" writes Harris. Wood's father opposed the idea, but his wife's """"overpowering ambition to make Natalie a star"""" took priority. According to Wood's younger sister, Lana, Pichel """"discovered her and wanted to adopt her.""""  Wood, then seven years old, got the part. She played a post-World War II German orphan, opposite Orson Welles as Wood's guardian, and Claudette Colbert, in Tomorrow Is Forever (1946). Welles later said that Wood was a born professional, """"so good, she was terrifying.""""[28] After Wood acted in another film directed by Pichel, her mother signed her with 20th Century Fox studio for her first major role, the 1947 Miracle on 34th Street, which has become a Christmas classic. Wood starred with Maureen O'Hara. She was counted among the top child stars in Hollywood after this film and was so popular that Macy's invited her to appear in the store's annual Thanksgiving Day parade.  Film historian John C. Tibbetts wrote that for the next few years following her success in Miracle, Wood played roles as a daughter in a series of family films: Fred MacMurray's daughter in Father Was a Fullback and Dear Brat, Margaret Sullavan's daughter in No Sad Songs for Me, James Stewart's daughter in The Jackpot, Joan Blondell's neglected daughter in The Blue Veil, and the daughter of Bette Davis' character in The Star.[3] In all, Wood appeared in over 20 films as a child.  Because Wood was a minor during her early years as an actress, she received her primary education on the studio lots wherever she was contracted. California law required that until age 18, child actors had to spend at least three hours per day in the classroom, notes Harris. """"She was a straight A student"""", and one of the few child actors to excel at arithmetic. Director Joseph L. Mankiewicz, who directed her in The Ghost and Mrs. Muir (1947), said that """"In all my years in the business, I never met a smarter moppet."""" Wood remembered that period in her life, saying, """"I always felt guilty when I knew the crew was sitting around waiting for me to finish my three hours. As soon as the teacher let us go, I ran to the set as fast as I could"""".  As a child actress, Wood received significant media attention. By age nine, she had been named the """"most exciting juvenile motion picture star of the year"""" by Parents.  Teen stardom [ edit ]  Wood with her younger sister Lana Wood in 1956  In the 1953–54 television season, Wood played Ann Morrison, the teenage daughter in The Pride of the Family, an ABC situation comedy. She successfully made the transition from child star to ingénue at age 16 when she co-starred with James Dean and Sal Mineo in Rebel Without a Cause (1955), Nicholas Ray's film about teenage rebellion. She was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. She followed this with a small, but crucial role in John Ford's The Searchers (1956).  Wood graduated from Van Nuys High School in 1956. She signed with Warner Brothers and was kept busy during the remainder of the decade in many """"girlfriend"""" roles, which she found unsatisfying. The studio cast her in two films opposite Tab Hunter, hoping to turn the duo into a box office draw that never materialized. Among the other films made at this time were 1958's Kings Go Forth and Marjorie Morningstar. As Marjorie Morningstar, Wood played the role of a young Jewish girl in New York City who has to deal with the social and religious expectations of her family as she tries to forge her own path and separate identity. She also had detractors. Film critic Pauline Kael referred to her as """"clever little Natalie Wood ... [the] most machine-tooled of Hollywood ingénues.""""[3]  Adult career [ edit ]  Wood in 1958  Tibbetts observed that Wood's characters in Rebel Without a Cause, The Searchers, and Marjorie Morningstar began to show her widening range of acting styles.[3] Her former """"childlike sweetness"""" was now being combined with a noticeable """"restlessness that was characteristic of the youth of the 1950s."""" After Wood appeared in the box office flop All the Fine Young Cannibals (1960), she lost momentum. Wood's career was in a transition period, having until then consisted of roles as a child or as a teenager.[3]  Splendor in the Grass [ edit ]  Biographer Suzanne Finstad noted that a """"turning point"""" in her life as an actress took place when she saw the film A Streetcar Named Desire (1951): """"She was transformed, in awe of director Elia Kazan and of Vivien Leigh's performance ... [who] became a role model for Natalie."""" """"Her roles raised the possibility that one's sensitivity could mark a person as a kind of victim,"""" noted Tibbetts.[3]  After a """"series of bad films, her career was already in decline"""", noted author Douglas Rathgeb.[33] Then she was cast in Kazan's Splendor in the Grass (1961) opposite Warren Beatty. Kazan wrote in his 1997 memoir that the """"sages"""" of the film community declared her """"washed up"""" as an actress, but he still wanted to interview her for his next film:  When I saw her, I detected behind the well-mannered 'young wife' front a desperate twinkle in her eyes ... I talked with her more quietly then and more personally. I wanted to find out what human material was there, what her inner life was ... Then she told me she was being psychoanalyzed. That did it. Poor R.J.[Wagner], I said to myself. I liked Bob Wagner, I still do.  Kazan cast Wood as the female lead in Splendor in the Grass, and her career rebounded. He felt that despite her earlier innocent roles, she had the talent and maturity to go beyond them. In the film, Warren Beatty's character was deprived of sexual love with Wood's character, and as a result turns to another, """"looser"""" girl. Wood's character could not handle the sexuality and after a breakdown was committed to a mental institution. Kazan writes that he cast her in the role partly because he saw in Wood's personality a """"true-blue quality with a wanton side that is held down by social pressure,"""" adding that """"she clings to things with her eyes,"""" a quality he found especially """"appealing.""""[3]  Finstad felt that although Wood had never trained in Method acting techniques, """"working with Kazan brought her to the greatest emotional heights of her career. The experience was exhilarating, but wrenching for Natalie, who faced her demons on Splendor."""" She adds that a scene in the film, as a result of """"Kazan's wizardry ... produced a hysteria in Natalie that may be her most powerful moment as an actress."""" Actor Gary Lockwood, who also acted in the film, felt that """"Kazan and Natalie were a terrific marriage, because you had this beautiful girl, and you had somebody that could get things out of her."""" Kazan's favorite scene in the movie was the last one, when Wood goes back to see her lost first love, Bud (Beatty). """"It's terribly touching to me. I still like it when I see it,"""" writes Kazan.  For her performance in Splendor in the Grass, Wood received nominations for the Academy Award, Golden Globe Award, and BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role.  West Side Story [ edit ]  In 1961, Wood played Maria in the Jerome Robbins and Robert Wise musical West Side Story, which was a major box office and critical success. Tibbetts noted similarities in her role in this film and the earlier Rebel Without a Cause. Here, she plays the role of a restless Puerto Rican girl on the West Side of Manhattan. She was to represent the """"restlessness of American youth in the 1950s"""", expressed by youth gangs and juvenile delinquency, along with early rock and roll. Both films, he observes, were """"modern allegories based on the 'Romeo and Juliet' theme, including private restlessness and public alienation. Where in Rebel she falls in love with the character played by James Dean, whose gang-like peers and violent temper alienated him from his family, in West Side Story she enters into a romance with a white former gang member whose threatening world of outcasts also alienated him from lawful behavior.[3]  Although the singing parts were sung by Marni Nixon, West Side Story is still regarded as one of Wood's best films. Wood sang when she starred in the 1962 film Gypsy. She co-starred in the slapstick comedy The Great Race (1965), with Jack Lemmon, Tony Curtis, and Peter Falk. Her ability to speak Russian was an asset given to her character Maggie DuBois. It justified the character's recording the progress of the race across Siberia, and entering the race at the beginning as a contestant. In 1964, at the age of 25, Wood received her third Academy Award nomination for Love with the Proper Stranger, making Wood (along with Teresa Wright) the youngest person to score three Oscar nominations. This record was later broken by Jennifer Lawrence in 2013 and Saoirse Ronan in 2017, both of which scored their third nominations at the age of 23.  Although many of Wood's films were commercially profitable, at times her acting was criticized. In 1966, Wood was given The Harvard Lampoon Worst Actress of the Year Award. She was the first performer in the award's history to accept it in person, and The Harvard Crimson wrote she was """"quite a good sport"""".[40]  Director Sydney Pollack was quoted as saying about Wood, """"When she was right for the part, there was no one better. She was a damn good actress."""" Other notable films starring Wood were Inside Daisy Clover (1965) and This Property Is Condemned (1966), both of which co-starred Robert Redford and brought Wood Golden Globe nominations for Best Actress. In both films, which were set during the Great Depression, Wood played small-town teens with big dreams. After the release of the films, Wood suffered emotionally and sought professional therapy. During this time, she turned down the Faye Dunaway role in Bonnie and Clyde (1967) because she did not want to be separated from her analyst.  After three years away from acting, Wood co-starred with Robert Culp and Elliott Gould in the hit Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice (1969), a comedy about sexual liberation. According to Tibbets, this was the first film in which """"the saving leavening of humor was brought to bear upon the many painful dilemmas portrayed in her adult films.""""[3]  After becoming pregnant in 1970 with her first child, Natasha Gregson, Wood went into semi-retirement. She acted in only four more theatrical films during the remainder of her life. She made a brief cameo appearance as herself in The Candidate (1972), reuniting her for a third time with Robert Redford.  Wood in 1979  Later career [ edit ]  She reunited on the screen with Robert Wagner in the television movie of the week The Affair (1973), and with Laurence Olivier and husband Wagner in an adaptation of Cat on a Hot Tin Roof (1976) for the British series Laurence Olivier Presents broadcast as a special by NBC. She made cameo appearances on Wagner's prime-time detective series Switch in 1978 as """"Bubble Bath Girl,"""" and Hart to Hart in 1979 as """"Movie Star"""".  Film roles that Wood turned down during her career hiatus went to Ali MacGraw in Goodbye, Columbus; Mia Farrow in The Great Gatsby; and Faye Dunaway in The Towering Inferno. Later, Wood chose to star in the disaster film Meteor (1979) with Sean Connery, and the sex comedy The Last Married Couple in America (1980), which failed at the box office. Her performance in the latter was praised and considered reminiscent of her performance in Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice. In Last Married Couple, Wood broke ground: Although an actress with a clean, middle-class image, she used the """"F"""" word in a frank marital discussion with her husband (George Segal).  In this period, Wood had more success in television, receiving high ratings and critical acclaim in 1979 for The Cracker Factory and especially the miniseries film From Here to Eternity, with Kim Basinger and William Devane. Wood's performance in the latter won her a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in 1980. Later that year, she starred in The Memory of Eva Ryker, which proved to be her last completed production.  At the time of her death, Wood was filming the science fiction film Brainstorm (1983), co-starring Christopher Walken and directed by Douglas Trumbull. She was also scheduled to star in a theatrical production of Anastasia with Wendy Hiller and in a film called Country of the Heart, playing a terminally ill writer who has an affair with a teenager, to be played by Timothy Hutton. Due to her untimely death, both of the latter projects were canceled. The ending of Brainstorm had to be re-written. A stand-in and sound-alikes were used to replace Wood for some of her critical scenes. The film was released posthumously on September 30, 1983, and was dedicated to her in the closing credits.  Wood appeared in 56 films for cinema and television. In one of her last interviews before her death, she was defined as """"our sexual conscience on the silver screen.""""[43] Following her death, Time magazine noted that although critical praise for Wood had been sparse throughout her career, """"she always had work"""".[44]  Personal life [ edit ]  In September 1956, Wood had a brief relationship with Elvis Presley.[45][46]  Wood had two highly publicized marriages to actor Robert Wagner.[47] Wood said that she had had a crush on Wagner since she was a child,[2] and on her 18th birthday, she went on a studio-arranged date with the 26-year-old actor. They married a year later on December 28, 1957; it was a union that her mother argued against. Wood and Wagner separated in June 1961 and divorced in April 1962.  Wood with husband Robert Wagner  On May 30, 1969, Wood married British producer Richard Gregson. The couple had dated for two and a half years prior to their marriage, while Gregson waited for his divorce to be finalized. In 1970 they had a daughter, Natasha. They separated in August 1971 after Wood overheard an inappropriate telephone conversation between her secretary and Gregson. The split marked a brief estrangement between Wood and her family when mother Maria and sister Lana told her to reconcile with Gregson for the sake of her newborn child. She filed for divorce, and it was finalized in April 1972.[49]  In early 1972, Wood resumed her relationship with Wagner. The couple remarried on July 16, 1972, five months after reconciling and three months after she divorced Gregson. Their daughter, Courtney Wagner, was born in 1974.  Wood's sister, Lana Wood, recalls this period:  Her marriage was considered to be one of the best in Hollywood, and there is no question that she was a devoted, loving — even adoring — mother and stepmother. She and R. J. had begun with love and built from there. They had overcome each other's problems and had reached an accommodation with time and the changes time brings. As with anybody else who has settled into making a long marriage work, they were far more determined than most people to make it work ...[51]  They remained married until Wood's death seven years later on November 29, 1981, at age 43.  A biography of Natalie Wood released in 2001 revealed that she was allegedly raped when she was 16 years old by a powerful actor at the time.[52][53] In 2018, on a 12-part podcast about Natalie's life, Lana Wood claimed the attack occurred inside the famed Chateau Marmont Hotel during an audition and went on """"for hours"""".[54]  Death [ edit ]  During the making of the film Brainstorm, Wood drowned at age 43 while on a weekend boat trip to Catalina Island on board Wagner's yacht, Splendour. Many of the circumstances surrounding her drowning are unknown; it was never determined how she entered the water. She was with her husband Robert Wagner, Brainstorm co-star Christopher Walken, and Splendour's captain, Dennis Davern, on the evening of November 28, 1981. Wood's body was recovered by authorities at 8:00 a.m. on November 29, one mile away from the boat, with a small Valiant-brand inflatable dinghy found beached nearby. According to Wagner, when he went to bed, Wood was not there.[55] The autopsy report revealed that Wood had bruises on her body and arms as well as an abrasion on her left cheek.[8]  Later, in his memoir Pieces of My Heart, Wagner acknowledged that he had an argument with Wood before she disappeared.[8] The autopsy found that Wood's blood alcohol content was 0.14% (the upper limit for driving a car legally was 0.10% in California at the time), and there were traces of two types of medication in her bloodstream: a motion-sickness pill and a painkiller, both of which increase the effects of alcohol. Following his investigation, Los Angeles County coroner Thomas Noguchi ruled her death an accident by drowning and hypothermia. According to Noguchi, Wood had been drinking and she may have slipped while trying to re-board the dinghy.[8][58] Her sister Lana voiced doubts, as Wood could not swim and had been “terrified“ of water all her life, and thus, according to her, would never have left the yacht on her own by dinghy.[59] Two witnesses, who had been on a boat nearby, stated they had heard a woman scream for help during the night.[60]  Wood was buried in Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery in Los Angeles. Scores of representatives of international media, photographers, and members of the public tried to attend her funeral; however, all were required to remain outside the cemetery walls. Among the celebrity attendees were Frank Sinatra, Elizabeth Taylor, Fred Astaire, Rock Hudson, David Niven, Gregory Peck, Gene Kelly, Elia Kazan and Laurence Olivier. Olivier flew in from London in order to attend the service.  Grave of Natalie Wood at Westwood Memorial Park  A 2004 TV film titled The Mystery of Natalie Wood, directed by Peter Bogdanovich and partly based on the biographies Natasha: the Biography of Natalie Wood written by Suzanne Finstad and Natalie & R.J. written by Warren G. Harris, chronicles Wood’s life and career.[63] Wood was portrayed by Justine Waddell.[64][65]  The case was reopened in November 2011 after Davern publicly stated that he had lied to police during the initial investigation and that Wood and Wagner had an argument that evening. He alleged that Wood had been flirting with Walken, that Wagner was jealous and enraged, and that following Wood’s disappearance, Wagner had prevented Davern from turning on the search lights and notifying authorities. According to Davern, Wagner was responsible for Wood’s death.[8][66][67][68] Walken hired a lawyer, cooperated with the investigation, and was not considered a suspect by authorities.[69]  In 2012, Los Angeles County Chief Coroner Lakshmanan Sathyavagiswaran amended Wood's death certificate and changed the cause of her death from accidental drowning to """"drowning and other undetermined factors.""""[7] The amended document included a statement that the circumstances of how Wood ended up in the water are """"not clearly established"""". The coroner's office had been instructed by detectives not to discuss or comment on the case.[7] On January 14, 2013, the Los Angeles County coroner's office offered a 10-page addendum to Wood's autopsy report. The addendum stated that she might have sustained some of the bruises on her body before she went into the water and drowned but that could not be definitively determined.[70] Forensic pathologist Michael Hunter speculated that Wood was particularly susceptible to bruising due to the drug synthroid, which she had taken.[71]  In February 2018, Wagner was named a person of interest in the investigation into Wood's death. He has denied any involvement.[72][73][74]  Filmography [ edit ]  Accolades [ edit ]  See also [ edit ]  References [ edit ]""",/home/yanwang_nuist/dev_workspace/prj_python/fnd-bootstrap/dataset/gossip/Images/gossip_test/HV4Qm6GfKKJoQ7Sa6TNs1UG2NRhy4N07.jpg,0.0

"""Prince Harry & Meghan Markle Relationship Timeline Less than a year after announcing their engagement, Meghan and Harry have announced they are expecting their first child together. In honor of their expanding family, we take a the top-secret relationship that lead to one of the highest profile weddings of the decade—and a new chapter in the history of the Windsor family.    How They Met  Harry and Markle first made each other's acquaintance on a blind date in early July, 2016. """"We were introduced actually by a mutual friend,"""" Harry revealed during the couple's first sit-down interview with the BBC following their engagement announcement. (E! News claims Harry's friend Violet von Westenholz is the one who introduced them, but others have speculated it was fashion designer Mischa Nonoo.)  The only thing that I asked was is he nice? Cause if he wasn't kind, it just didn’t seem like it would make sense.  Despite Prince Harry's global fame, Markle says she didn't have a lot of preconceived notions about who he was before they met. """"Because I’m from the States, you don’t grow up with the same understanding of the royal family,"""" she explained during the BBC interview. """"I didn’t know much about him, so the only thing that I had asked [our mutual friend] when she said that she wanted to set us up, was, 'Well is he nice?' Cause if he wasn't kind, it just didn’t seem like it would make sense.""""  Prince Harry and Meghan Markle during the televised interview following the announcement of their engagement. YouTube  The two hit it off immediately. """"We met for a drink,"""" said Markle, """"and then I think very quickly into that we said, 'Well what are we doing tomorrow? We should meet again.'""""  At the photo call in the Kensington Palace gardens following their engagement announcement, Harry was asked when he knew Markle was the one. He quickly replied, """"the very first time we met.""""  Things moved quickly from there. The couple went on a second date and Prince Harry then invited Markle to accompany him on a trip to Africa just three or four weeks later. """"I managed to persuade her to come and join me in Botswana and we camped out with each other under the stars,"""" he said, describing the whirlwind romance. """"Then we were really by ourselves, which was crucial to me to make sure that we had a chance to get to know each other.""""    The News Gets Out  After four months of quiet dating, the news finally leaked on October 31, 2016 that Prince Harry was dating an American actress. A source told the Sunday Express that Harry is “happier than he’s been for many years” and is """"besotted"""" with the Markle. On the same day, Markle posted a sweet photo on her Instagram of two bananas spooning, possibly hinting at the new love in her life.

Meghan Meets the Family  My cup runneth over and I’m the luckiest girl in the world.  In November 2016, the Vancouver Sun published an interview with Markle promoting her collection for retailer Reitmans.

Getty Images  According to Harry, he has been involved with “nightly legal battles” to stop the media from publishing defamatory stories about Markle and their relationship.  Prince Harry is worried about Ms. Markle’s safety and is deeply disappointed that he has not been able to protect her. It is not right that a few months into a relationship with him that Ms. Markle should be subjected to such a storm. He knows commentators will say this is ‘the price she has to pay’ and that ‘this is all part of the game’. He strongly disagrees. This is not a game - it is her life and his.  During the BBC interview, Harry revealed that both he and Markle were taken aback by the media scrutiny. """"I think both of us were totally surprised by the reaction.""""  Many assumed that Markle would be prepared for the onslaught of attention because she had been in the public eye as an actress, but little could have prepared her for what was to come. """"There was a misconception that because I have worked in the entertainment industry that this would be something I would be familiar with,"""" she said. """"But I've never been part of tabloid culture. I've never been in pop culture to that degree and and lived a relatively quiet life.""""  Prince Harry with school children in Antigua in November, 2016. Getty Images  Her answer, she told the BBC, was to tune out the noise. """"I think we were just hit so hard at the beginning with a lot of mistruths that I made the choice to not read anything, positive or negative. It just didn't make sense and instead we focused all of our energies just on nurturing our relationship.""""

Even Prince William Is Forced to Weigh In  On November 27, 2016, Prince William released a statement to clear up rumors that he was unhappy with his brother's decision to open up about his relationship.

To encourage people to open up about their mental health issues, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and the Duke of Sussex initiated the mental health awareness campaign """"Heads Together"""" in April 2016.[9] The media has called Catherine's impact on British and American fashion the """"Kate Middleton effect"""".[10] In 2012 and 2013, Time magazine selected her as one of the 100 Most Influential People in the World.[11][12]  Early life  Catherine Elizabeth Middleton was born at the Royal Berkshire Hospital in Reading on 9 January 1982 into an upper-middle-class family.[13][14][15][16][17] She was baptised at St Andrew's Bradfield, Berkshire, on 20 June 1982.[18][20] She is the eldest of three children born to Michael Middleton (b. 1949),[21] and his wife, Carole (née Goldsmith; b. 1955),[22] a former flight dispatcher and flight attendant, respectively, who in 1987 founded Party Pieces, a privately held mail order company that sells party supplies and decorations with an estimated worth of £30 million.[23][24][25] Her father's family has ties to British aristocracy and benefited financially from trust funds which they established over 100 years ago.[26][27][14][28] Her Middleton relatives were reported as having played host to British royalty """"as long ago as 1926"""".[29][30] She has a younger sister, Pippa, and a younger brother, James.[31]  The family lived in Amman, Jordan, from May 1984 to September 1986 where her father worked for British Airways (BA). Middleton attended an English-language nursery school.[32][33] When her family returned to Berkshire in 1986, she was enrolled aged four at St Andrew's School, a private school near Pangbourne in Berkshire. She boarded part-weekly at St Andrew's in her later years.[34] She studied at Downe House School.[35] She was a boarder at Marlborough College, a co-educational independent boarding school in Wiltshire,[36][37] and graduated in 2005 from the University of St Andrews in Fife, Scotland, with an undergraduate MA (2:1 Hons) in the history of art.[38] Before university, during a gap year, she travelled to Chile to participate in a Raleigh International programme, and studied at the British Institute of Florence in Italy.[39]  In November 2006, Middleton worked as an accessory buyer with the clothing chain Jigsaw,[40] where she worked part-time until November 2007. She also worked until January 2011 at the family business in catalogue design and production, marketing, and photography.[18][41] Prior to her marriage, Middleton lived in an apartment owned by her parents in Chelsea, London, which was estimated to be worth £1–1.4 million.[42] In 2018, Catherine's total net worth was estimated at £5–7.3 million, most of which is from her parents' company.[42]  Relationship with Prince William  Early relationship  In 2001, Middleton met Prince William while they were students in residence at St Salvator's Hall at the University of St Andrews.[43] She reportedly caught William's eye at a charity fashion show at the university in 2002 when she appeared on the stage wearing a see-through lace dress.[44] The couple began dating in 2003, although their relationship remained unconfirmed.[45] During their second year, Middleton shared a flat with William and two other friends.[46] On 17 October 2005, Middleton complained through her lawyer about harassment from the media, stating she had done nothing significant to warrant publicity.[47]  Middleton attended Prince William's Passing Out Parade at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst on 15 December 2006.[48][49] Media attention increased around the time of her 25th birthday in January 2007, prompting warnings from the Prince of Wales, Prince William, and Middleton's lawyers, who threatened legal action. Two newspaper groups, News International, which publishes The Times and The Sun; and the Guardian Media Group, publishers of The Guardian, decided to refrain from publishing paparazzi photographs of her.[50]  In April 2007, Prince William and Middleton split up. The couple decided to break up during a holiday in the Swiss resort of Zermatt.[51] Newspapers speculated about the reasons for the split, although these reports relied on anonymous sources. Middleton and her family attended the Concert for Diana in July 2007 at Wembley Stadium,[46] where she and Prince William sat two rows apart. The couple were subsequently seen together in public on a number of occasions and news sources stated that they had """"rekindled their relationship"""".[52]  On 17 May 2008, Middleton attended the wedding of Prince William's cousin Peter Phillips to Autumn Kelly, which the prince did not attend.[53] On 19 July 2008, she was a guest at the wedding of Lady Rose Windsor and George Gilman. Prince William was away on military operations in the Caribbean, serving aboard HMS Iron Duke.[54] In 2010, Middleton pursued an invasion of privacy claim against two agencies and photographer Niraj Tanna, who took photographs of her over Christmas 2009.[55] She obtained a public apology, £5,000 in damages, and legal costs.[56]  Marriage and children  The newly married Duke and Duchess of Cambridge on the balcony of Buckingham Palace (2011)  Prince William and Catherine Middleton became engaged in October 2010, in Kenya, during a 10-day trip to the Lewa Wildlife Conservancy to celebrate his passing the RAF helicopter search and rescue course.[57][58] Clarence House announced the engagement on 16 November 2010.[57][59] Prince William gave Middleton the engagement ring that had belonged to his mother, Diana, Princess of Wales. The couple married in Westminster Abbey on 29 April 2011[60] (St. Catherine's Day), with the day declared a bank holiday in the United Kingdom. Estimates of the global audience for the wedding ranged around 300 million or more, whilst 26 million watched the event live in Britain alone.[61][62][63] On marriage, Catherine assumed the style """"Her Royal Highness The Duchess of Cambridge"""".[64]  In October, several months after the wedding, Commonwealth leaders pledged that they would implement changes in British royal succession law to adopt absolute primogeniture, meaning the first child of the Duke and Duchess, whether male or female, would be next in line to the throne after their father.[65]  William and Catherine with their first son the day after his birth (2013)  On 3 December 2012, St James's Palace announced that the Duchess was pregnant with her first child. The announcement was made earlier in the pregnancy than is usual as she had been admitted to King Edward VII's Hospital suffering from hyperemesis gravidarum, a severe form of morning sickness. She remained in the hospital for three days.[66][67] Prince George was born at St Mary's Hospital in London on 22 July 2013.[4][5] The severe morning sickness returned with the subsequent pregnancies, forcing Catherine to cancel her official engagements.[68] She gave birth to Princess Charlotte on 2 May 2015[69] and to Prince Louis on 23 April 2018.[70]  Public life  Middleton's first public appearance with Prince William following the announcement of their engagement was at a fundraising event organised by the Teenage Cancer Trust in December 2010.[71] She was formally introduced to public life on 24 February 2011, two months before the wedding, when she and Prince William attended a lifeboat-naming ceremony in Trearddur, Anglesey, in North Wales.[72] A day later they appeared in St Andrews to launch the university's 600th anniversary celebrations.[73] In March 2011, the couple toured Belfast.[74] Their last public engagement before the wedding was a visit to Darwen Aldridge Community Academy.[75][76] On 16 February 2011, Clarence House announced the couple's first royal tour of Canada would take place in July 2011.[77] In May 2011, shortly after the wedding, Clarence House announced the Duke and Duchess would extend their tour to visit California.[78] This was to be the Duchess's first visit to the United States.[79]  Catherine and William meet the Obamas at Buckingham Palace two weeks after their wedding (2011)  The Duchess's first official engagement after the wedding came in May, when she and her husband met Barack Obama, the President of the United States, and First Lady Michelle Obama.[80] On 26 October 2011, she undertook her first solo event for In Kind Direct, stepping in for the Prince of Wales, who was in Saudi Arabia.[81] On 2 November, the Duke and Duchess visited the UNICEF Supply Division Centre for supplying food to malnourished African children in Copenhagen, Denmark.[82][83] On St. Patrick's Day, 17 March 2012, the Duchess carried out the traditional awarding of shamrocks to the Irish Guards at their base in Aldershot; this was her first solo military engagement.[84] On 19 March, she gave her first speaking engagement for the opening of the Treehouse, a new children's hospice opened by East Anglia's Children's Hospices (EACH), a charity of which she is a patron.[85]  In June 2012, The Foundation of Prince William and Prince Harry was renamed The Royal Foundation of The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry, to reflect Catherine's contribution to the charity.[86] The Duke and Duchess were announced as ambassadors for the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, alongside Prince Harry.[87] As part of her role, the Duchess attended numerous sporting events throughout the games.[88] In September 2012, the Duke and Duchess embarked on a tour of Singapore, Malaysia, Tuvalu, and the Solomon Islands as part of the Queen's Diamond Jubilee celebrations.[89] During this overseas visit, she made her first official speech abroad, while visiting a hospice in Malaysia, drawing on her experience as patron of East Anglia's Children's Hospices.[90][91]  After the birth of Prince George, the Duchess carried out her first engagement in late August when she accompanied the Duke to meet runners preparing for an ultra-marathon on the isle of Anglesey, where they had a residence.[92][93] At the beginning of March 2014, details were announced of the half-month-long tour to New Zealand and Australia that the couple and their son would be taking from 16 to 25 April.[94] The tour was Catherine's first visit to the area and Prince George's first major public appearance since his christening in October 2013.[95] The tour began in New Zealand where they visited Wellington, Blenheim, Auckland, Dunedin, Queenstown and Christchurch. It ended in Australia where they visited Sydney, the Blue Mountains, Brisbane, Uluru, Adelaide, and Canberra.[96] In June 2014, the couple visited France to attend the commemoration of the 70th anniversary of the Normandy landings at Gold Beach.[97]  On 21 July 2014, it was announced that the Duchess would be making her first solo trip, visiting the island of Malta on 20–21 September 2014, when the island was celebrating its 50th independence anniversary.[98] Her trip was cancelled, with the Duke taking her place, after the announcement of her second pregnancy in early September.[99] In December 2014, the couple visited the United States and attended a charity dinner at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.[100] In April 2016, the Duchess and her husband undertook a tour to India and Bhutan.[101] The Duke and Duchess toured Canada again in September 2016.[102] Countries visited by the couple in 2017 include France, Poland, Germany, and Belgium.[103][104][105][106] The Duchess takes official portraits of her children and joined the Royal Photographic Society in 2017.[107] She visited Luxembourg City in May 2017 for the Treaty of London commemorations.[108] In January 2018, the couple visited Sweden and Norway.[109]  Charity work  Patronages  In March 2011, the Duke and Duchess set up a gift fund held by The Foundation of Prince William and Prince Harry to allow well-wishers who wanted to give them a wedding gift to donate money to charities they care about instead.[110][111] The gift fund supported 26 charities of the couple's choice, incorporating the armed forces, children, the elderly, art, sport and conservation. These causes were close to their hearts and reflected the experiences, passions and values of their lives.[112][113]  The Duchess of Cambridge's charity works focus mainly on issues surrounding young children, addiction, and art.[114] She has a number of patronages: The Art Room, National Portrait Gallery, East Anglia's Children's Hospice, Action on Addiction, Place2Be, Natural History Museum, Anna Freud Centre, Sportsaid, and The 1851 Trust.[115][116][117] The Duchess, who was an art student, takes an interest in art and handpicked the Art Room, which """"helps disadvantaged children express themselves"""" through art therapy, and the National Portrait Gallery.[118] In her capacity as patron of Action on Addiction, the Duchess has occasionally made visits to its centres, spending time with recovering addicts.[119] The Duchess is joint Patron of 100 Women in Hedge Fund's Philanthropic Initiatives, along with Prince William and Prince Harry.[120] She is also a local volunteer leader with the Scout Association in north Wales,[121] of which the Queen is patron, and the Duke of Kent is president.[114] It aims to provide activities to over 400,000 young people in the UK.[114]  In October 2012, the Duchess gave her royal patronage to the M-PACT programme (Moving Parents and Children Together), one of the only UK programmes to focus specifically on the impact of drug addiction on families.[122] In December 2015, she assumed the patronage of the Royal Air Force Air Cadets[123] for youths 12–19 years of age. The Duke of Edinburgh, who had been patron of the RAF Cadets for 63 years, formally handed over during an audience at Buckingham Palace.[124] In 2017, she replaced the Queen as patron of The Lawn Tennis Association,[125] All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club,[126] and Action for Children.[127]  In January 2018, locks of her hair were reportedly donated to the Little Princess Trust, a charity which makes wigs for children diagnosed with cancer.[128] In February 2018, the Duchess became the patron of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists.[129][130] She also launched Nursing Now, a three-year worldwide campaign to raise awareness about the profile of nurses. She said the campaign was personal to her as both her grandmother and great-grandmother were volunteer nurses.[131][129][130][132] In March 2018, Kensington Palace announced the Duchess of Cambridge would become the first royal patron of the Victoria and Albert Museum.[133][134]  In January 2019, it was confirmed that the Duchess would work together with the Royal Horticultural Society as one of the co-designers for a garden display at the 2019 Chelsea Flower Show. The project, titled """"Back to Nature Garden"""", has been designed with an emphasis on """"the benefits of the natural world on our mental and physical wellbeing.""""[135][136]  Advocating for mental health  Catherine, who has tackled issues surrounding mental health and disabilities, has made visits to charities and hospitals such as St Thomas' Hospital and Maurice Wohl Clinical Neuroscience Institute to spend time with mothers and children who deal with these issues.[137][138][139] To encourage people to open up about their mental health issues, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry initiated the mental health awareness campaign """"Heads Together"""" in April 2016. The Duchess later voluntarily talked about her problems as a mother, and admitted that she suffered a """"lack of confidence"""" and """"feelings of ignorance"""" during certain periods of time.[9][137][140]  The Duchess of Cambridge also launched the Mentally Healthy Schools, a project which helps the students and staff with access """"to reliable and practical resources to improve awareness, knowledge and confidence in supporting pupils' mental health.""""[141] Benita Refson, president of Place2Be, one of Catherine's patronages, has praised the Duchess's work saying she would help """"shine the spotlight on child mental health.""""[142] In February 2016, she travelled to Edinburgh to promote the work of Place2Be, launched Children's Mental Health Week, and contributed to the HuffPost UK as a part of the Young Minds Matter movement, an effort """"to raise awareness for children's mental health issues.""""[143][144] The Duke and Duchess later met with members and representatives of Young Minds and Youthscape to promote their mental health campaign.[145] In recognition of their work with charities concerned with children's mental health, the Duchess and her husband were awarded the Gold Blue Peter badge, an award previously granted to the Queen.[146] During a speech at the Royal Foundation forum in 2018, the Duchess said she would continue her work to raise awareness for mental health and said that """"The mental health of children and adults is one area where a long-term view will make all the difference to future generations.""""[147]  Public image and style  Middleton, prominent for her fashion style, has been placed on numerous """"best dressed"""" lists.[148][149] The Daily Telegraph selected her as the Most Promising Newcomer on its 2006 list of style winners and losers.[150] Tatler placed her at number eight on its yearly list of the top ten style icons in 2007.[151] People featured her on its 2007 and 2010 best-dressed lists.[152] Middleton was named one of Richard Blackwell's ten Fabulous Fashion Independents of 2007.[153] In June 2008, Style.com selected her as its monthly beauty icon.[154] In July 2008, Vanity Fair included her on its international best-dressed list.[155] In February 2011 the Global Language Monitor named her the Top Fashion buzzword of the 2011 season.[156] In January 2012, the Headwear Association voted her Headwear Person of the Year.[157] Middleton was number one on Vanity Fair's annual best dressed lists in 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013; she also appeared as the cover star in 2012.[158] The Duchess was named to the International Best Dressed Hall of Fame List in 2014.[159] In 2014, she was already being regarded as a British cultural icon, with young adults from abroad naming her among a group of people who they most associated with UK culture. These included: William Shakespeare, Queen Elizabeth II, David Beckham, J. K. Rowling, The Beatles, Charlie Chaplin, Elton John and Adele.[160][161] In June 2016, she took part in her first magazine shoot for Vogue's centenary issue appearing on the cover.[162] In 2018, Tatler named her on its list of Britain's best dressed people, praising her for """"recycling her looks, rather than wearing them as one-offs"""", as well as her use of """"both high street and high-end brands"""".[163]  The """"Kate Middleton effect""""[10][164] is the trend that the Duchess is reported to have had on others in sales of particular products. While Catherine wears items from many new designers, she has also worn dresses by Catherine Walker, who designed many of Diana's favourite evening gowns and day suits.[165] She has worn outfits, hats and ensembles by many other fashion designers.[166][167] The brands she favours are noted in the media.[166][167]  The Duchess, who attended the 71st British Academy Film Awards, did not participate in Time's Up movement calling for women to wear black on the red carpet.[168] Royal protocol forbids members of the royal family from taking part in political movements but she wore a black sash and carried a black handbag as a variation to the informal black dress code.[169][170] In March 2018, together with the Countess of Wessex, the Duchess hosted the Commonwealth Fashion Exchange reception at Buckingham Palace during 2018 London Fashion Week.[171]  Privacy and the media  The death of Diana, Princess of Wales, in Paris while being chased by paparazzi in 1997,[172] influenced the Duke's attitude towards the media.[173] The Duchess and her husband have asked that, when off-duty, their privacy should be respected.[173]  In 2009, before her engagement to William, Middleton was awarded £10,000 damages and an apology from the photographic press agency Rex Features Ltd. after she was photographed playing tennis on Christmas Eve while on holiday in Cornwall.[174]  In September 2012, the French edition of Closer and the Italian gossip magazine Chi, published photographs of the Duchess sun-bathing topless while on holiday at the Château d'Autet[173] (a private château on a 260-ha estate 71 km[175] north of Aix-en-Provence). Analysts from The Times believed the photographs were taken from the D22 (Vaucluse) road half a kilometre from the pool—a distance that would require an 800-mm or a 1000-mm lens.[176] On 17 September 2012, the Duke and Duchess filed a criminal complaint with the French prosecution department and launched a claim for civil damages at the Tribunal de Grande Instance de Nanterre.[177] The following day the courts granted an injunction against Closer prohibiting further publication of the photographs and announced a criminal investigation would be initiated.[178] Under French law, punitive damages cannot be awarded[179] but intrusions of privacy are a criminal offence carrying a maximum jail sentence of one year and a fine of up to €45,000 for individuals and €225,000 for companies.[180][181] In September 2017, Closer was fined €100,000 and its editor Laurence Pieau and owner Ernesto Mauri were each fined €45,000.[182]  In December 2012, two Australian radio hosts, Michael Christian and Mel Greig, called King Edward VII's Hospital where the Duchess was an in-patient for hyperemesis gravidarum. Pretending to be the Queen and the Prince of Wales, Greig and Christian spoke to a nurse on the Duchess's ward, enquiring about her condition. Following a hospital inquiry and a public backlash against the hoax, Jacintha Saldanha, the nurse who put the call through to the ward, committed suicide.[183] The radio hosts subsequently apologised for their actions.[184]  In February 2013, Chi published the first photos of Catherine's exposed baby bump, taken during her vacation on the private island of Mustique. The British press refused to publish the paparazzi shots.[185] While the Duchess was visiting the Blue Mountains in Sydney, a picture was taken of her bare bottom as her dress blew up. Many newspapers outside the UK published the picture.[186]  On 14 August 2015, Kensington Palace published a letter detailing what it stated were the """"dangerous"""" and invasive efforts of the media to get paparazzi pictures of Prince George and Princess Charlotte. Jason Knauf, communications secretary to the Cambridges, wrote the letter to media standards organisations in various countries.[187]  Titles, styles, honours and arms  Titles and styles  Royal monogram  Catherine is, by marriage, a princess of the United Kingdom and entitled to the style of Royal Highness.[188] She is usually styled as """"Her Royal Highness The Duchess of Cambridge"""".[189] When in Scotland, she is referred to as the Countess of Strathearn.[190] Northern Ireland is represented by a third title, Lady Carrickfergus.[189][a]  Honours  Commonwealth honours  Honorary military appointments  5 July 2011 – present: Canadian Ranger  Honorific eponym  Awards  Arms  In September 2013, the Queen granted a conjugal coat of arms to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, consisting of their individual arms displayed side by side, beneath a helm and coronet denoting the duke's status as grandson of the sovereign.[199] Below is shown the earlier grant of the duchess's personal arms, impaled with those of her husband.  Ancestry  The Duchess of Cambridge's father, Michael, and her paternal ancestors were from Leeds, Yorkshire. Her paternal great-grandmother Olive was a member of the Lupton family, who are described in the City of Leeds Archives as """"landed gentry, a political and business dynasty""""; previously unpublished pictures revealed in March 2015 that Olive Middleton had grown up at the family's ancestral seat of Potternewton Hall Estate[203] alongside her cousin, Baroness von Schunck (née Kate Lupton).[31][204][205][206][207] Catherine's paternal ancestors also include her great-great-grandfather politician Francis Martineau Lupton (1848–1921), whose first cousin Sir Thomas Martineau was the uncle of World War II Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain.[208]  The Duchess's maternal ancestors, the Harrisons, were working-class labourers and miners from Sunderland and County Durham.[209] Ancestors through her maternal line include Sir Thomas Conyers, 9th Baronet (1731–1810), who was a descendant of King Edward IV through his illegitimate daughter Elizabeth Plantagenet.[210] Other ancestors are Sir Thomas Fairfax (1475–1520) and his wife Anne Gascoigne, who was a descendant of King Edward III.[211][212]  Notes  ^ Even with the title Lady Carrickfergus, she is still mostly referred to as the Duchess of Cambridge in Northern Ireland, as per given sources.

"""Michael Strahan, Sara Haines Will Host ABC’s New ‘GMA’ Hour ABC will tie Michael Strahan even more closely to its “Good Morning America” franchise when it pairs the popular host with Sara Haines in a third hour of the program slated to air in early afternoon on the network starting September 10.  A person familiar with the program confirmed details about its hosts and disclosed the show’s start date. ABC News, which produces the program, declined to make executives available for comment.  Launch of the show will extend the presence of “GMA” to the network’s daytme schedule from its early-morning grid, and allow ABC to create bigger packages for advertisers, as NBC does with four hours of “Today.” The idea should also boost affiliates, as ABC can promote the extension during the main “GMA” broadcast that airs between 7 a.m. and 9 a.m.  The new hour is expected to be taped, not presented live, and run at 1 p.m. on weekdays. One scenario that has been discussed for the new hour would involve making use of the live, in-studio audience assembled each morning for the 8 a.m. hour of the flagship show. ABC said earlier this year it would replace “The Chew” with the new “GMA” hour.  “Good Morning America” enjoyed an afternoon presence in the not-too-distant past. Josh Elliott and Lara Spencer co-anchored a short run of “Good Afternoon America” between July and September of 2012 in a separate bid to test expansion of the franchise.  “GMA” makes its leap as its battle for viewers with main rival“Today” remains intense. “Good Morning America” remains TV’s most-watched morning program, but “Today, co-anchored by Hoda Kotb and Savannah Guthrie, typically wins more viewers between 25 and 54, the demographic most favored by advertisers. Season to date as of July 13, “Today” has lured 151,000 more viewers between 25 and 54 than its primary competitor, while “GMA” has notched 63,000 more viewers than “Today” overall.  The expansion to afternoons comes as ABC is also working to expand the digital presence for the show. In April, “GMA” launched a morning newsletter and unveiled a revamped “GMA” website that was not tied to ABC News’ content deal with Yahoo. At the time, Michael Corn, “GMA’ senior executive producer, noted that producers often gathered together more information and material than the 7 a.m. to 9 a.m. program could handle. “We have so much content and a two-hour program isn’t even enough for the amount of stories we have to tell, and the amount of information we have,” he toldVariety.  Haines will leave “The View” to participate in the new program, marking the second departure of an ABC News correspondent from the program in recent days. ABC News announced earlier this week that Faris would leave her position at the show to do focus on reporting bigger stories. That narrows “The View” table down to four hosts: Whoopi Goldberg, Joy Behar, Sunny Hostin and Meghan McCain. Details about the hosts for the third “GMA” hour were reported previously by Page Six.""",/home/yanwang_nuist/dev_workspace/prj_python/fnd-bootstrap/dataset/gossip/Images/gossip_test/XsfbmiEJ45qEvIM3fq3okkGkIS2U5A1i.jpg,1.0
"""Robin Roberts and Michael Strahan spark feud rumors A little less than a year after his hasty exit from Live With Kelly, Michael Strahan is reportedly at odds with yet another of his early morning co-hosts.  The popular ABC personality and longtime Good Morning America host Robin Roberts are rumored to be feuding after photos emerged of the pair having what looked to be a heated argument on the morning of January 26 while on the set of their show.  But the rumor turns out to be just that, with multiple people who have knowledge of the situation telling DailyMail.com that the pictures in question show Strahan and Roberts in an animated conversation about sports with ESPN reporter Tom Rinaldi, a guest on the program that morning.  The exact nature of the talk is not known, but the three were likely discussing the news coming out of Australia just hours prior that Venus and Serena Williams would be meeting in their first Grand Slam final in eight years.  Scroll down for video  Heated hosts: Rumors emerged earlier this week that Good Moring America co-hosts Robin Roberts and Michael Strahan were feuding on set  Less than optimal optics: The pair were photographed on the set of the popular ABC morning show January 26 having an animated conversation  Making a point: Roberts could be seen motioning with her hands while speaking with ESPN reporter Tom Rinaldi as Strahan stood silently by her side  The day the photos were taken was perhaps the biggest news day of the year to date at the show, which started off the morning by airing exclusive footage from World News Tonight anchor David Muir's exclusive sitdown with President Donald Trump.  It was the newly inaugurated commander-in-chief's first network interview of his presidency.  The show that day also focused on the news that television icon Mary Tyler Moore had passed away one day prior.  Then came Rinaldi's segment on the program about the Williams sisters showdown in Melbourne, with the two both having won their semifinal matches in the Australian Open shortly before airtime to set up a meeting in the finals of the Grand Slam event.  Strahan introduced Rinaldi, who broke down the story as Roberts and her retired football player co-host both excitedly talked about the news on air.  It was featured on the Big Board segment of the show, during which the talking heads are normally not in the studio with the hosts, but that was not the case on the day in question.  Historic day: Multiple sources with knoledge of the situation tell DailyMail.com that the three were excitedly discussing Venus and Serena Williams  Shut it down: 'The only disagreement on set was over who was going to win the Super Bowl' said an insider  Rinaldi was actually in Times Square with Starhan and Roberts, and the three sat down at the desk to the side of the anchor's table to discuss the story.  After raving about the talent of the girls and this 'imprabable' meting, Roberts discussed how amazing it was that the pair's parents predicted this success for their daughters decades ago.  The two then joked about how Strahan, like the Williams sisters continued his career into his mid-thirties and noted how 'dapper' Rinaldi looked in his suit before the show went to commercial break.  It was right before that Big Board segment when photos were taken that showed Roberts gesturing towards Rinaldi while Strahan stood by her side.  Some thought that the ESPN host was a producer and Roberts was complaining about Strahan, but in fact the three were just discussing the sisters win before the show returned to air.  And as seen during the segment, Roberts,m Strahan and Rinaldi were all in jovial moods and did not appear to have just had a heated discussion.  Mistaken identity: The rumors began when some thought that Rinadi was a producer for the program to whom Roberts was voicing complaints  After rumors began to fly about a possible feud and insider said: 'The only disagreement on set was over who was going to win the Super Bowl. Everyone at GMA is thrilled to have Michael on the show full-time. He’s a fantastic addition to the team.'  Roberts publicly stated how fond she was of Strahan too earlier this week when she posted a photo of him laughing on the set to her Twitter account - on Valentine's Day.  She wrote that Strahan 'does make me laugh...he brightens my morning every day!'  That was followed by an emoji with two giant heart-eyes.  Strahan returned the love by retweeting Roberts and adding a emoji of a kissing face that same day.  Live in person: Rinaldi's report came during the show's Big Board segment, and he was live in studio that day  Rumors of tension on set are nothing new to Strahan.  News of his departure last April from Live With Kelly & Michel was surrounded by drama after Ripa did not turn up for work the day after it was announced he was moving to Good Morning America full-time come September.  Ripa, it turned out, had been blindsided by the news and it was a week before she returned to her hosting duties.  'I wasn't surprised by her reaction at all, but I can't control somebody else's actions,' he reflected later in a interview with People.  'I was there four years, and it's about more than just being in front of the camera.'  Strahan, 44, who had been on Live! for four years, added: 'Toward the end of it all, we didn't communicate that much. I kinda looked at it like, """"It was what it was.""""  Keeping quiet: Strahan and Roberts were also seen quietly sitting next to one another during breaks  Roberts expressed her love for Strahan on Valentine's Day, tweeting about how much he makes her laugh  Strahan shared his admiration for his co-host by retweeting the message and adding an emoji  'The show was going well? We're all winning. That's all that matters to me.'  The drama was so bad that Strahan left Live! earlier than planned at the network's request, leaving Kelly, 46, to begin the process of finding a new co-host.  'The most disappointing thing to me was that I was painted as the bad guy,' said Strahan.  'I value the way I carry myself,' he said. 'I don't want people to see me as """"Oh, he just ran out, just left them there."""" That's just not true.  'On air all I could do was control myself. In football, New York is the toughest place to play. One day you're the greatest player they've ever seen, then the next game you're the worst.  'But I got older in that business and I said, """"Hey, it doesn't matter what their opinion is. All I know is I'm doing my best, and I'm giving it everything I have.""""'  Strahan also said of his relationship with Ripa: 'At one point I think we were friends. I don't know what happened in the end'.  Reading glasses: The pair used their commercial breaks to prep for upcoming segments on that day  Executives at ABC were apparently less than thrilled with Strahan however after his comments about Ripa in that interview.  'They were livid,' a source told DailyMail.com about the reaction of multiple executives when they read the story.  'Things had finally calmed down and then he goes and does this interview, throwing Ben Sherwood under the bus.'  Sherwood, the rpesident of ABC, had just issued a public apology to Ripa and about how the situation was handled just one week prior.  A spokesperson for ABC shot down claims that anyone at the network was 'livid,' pointing out that Strahan's story got its own segment on the program the week that it hit newsstands.  That segment did not however mention Strahan's comments about Ripa or Live  The source also said that the team at Good Morning America was also less than thrilled with the Strahan story.  'They think it looks like he came in with his own agenda - which is himself,' said the source.  Strahan was also involved in a feud with former Live co-host Kelly Ripa after he decided to leave the show for GMA  'It is just clear that he is always trying to blame everyone but himself for what happened when in fact he is the one who said on Live two years ago that he would never leave the show and wasn't going anywhere.'  Ripa made it clear she was angry with both the network and Strahan when she learned he was leaving the show for Good Morning America on April 19 only an hour before it was publicly announced.  After missing four episodes, Ripa held hands with Strahan as she returned to the set on April 26 and joked that the 'long national nightmare' was over.  'I needed a couple days to gather my thoughts,' she told the audience that day.  'After 26 years with this company, I earned the right. Let's be honest, I know half of you called in sick to be here, so we get each other.'  Ripa added that 'apologies have been made' and said she was thrilled for Strahan, who was chosen to be Regis Philbin's successor on the show in 2012.  She has been hosting the show since Strahan's exit with guest hosts including her husband Mark Consuelos, close friends Anderson Cooper and Andy Cohen, and Pennsylvania high school teacher Richard Curtis, who won the Live co-hot search.  Megyn Kelly also stopped by the day after the election in a rare early appearance for the primetime news host that came just two months before it was revealed she had signed a new contract with NBC where she will have her own morning show.""",/home/yanwang_nuist/dev_workspace/prj_python/fnd-bootstrap/dataset/gossip/Images/gossip_test/mKiFJxTNAeQ0Ao2tb8trW5cX8HHVM8bE.jpg,1.0

"""See Inside Gwen Stefani's Over-The-Top Beverly Hills Mansion Gwen Stefani is having a hard-time selling the mega mansion she shared with ex-husband Gavin Rossdale — possibly because it’s not for the faint of heart (or the shallow of wallet).  Simon Berlyn  According to Variety, the former couple purchased the 11,845-square-foot Beverly Hills estate for $13.25 million in 2006 and listed it in 2016 for $35 million following their divorce. Stefani dropped the asking price to $29 million earlier this year.  Simon Berlyn  Designer Kelly Wearstler lent her trademark glam to the 10-bedroom house, which is a whirlwind of marble facades, graphic patterns, and neon colors. The decor ranges from Hollywood regency to space age to ultra modern. Floor-to-ceiling windows look out onto the San Fenando valley, and vaulted ceilings, skylights, and hardwood flooring complete the package.  Simon Berlyn  Six of the bedrooms have ensuite bathrooms, and the master bedroom boasts a walk-in closet with chic carpeting and wood paneling. The black-and-white striped kitchen is a true show stopper though, with hidden storage space and an adjoining breakfast room with a built-in leather banquette.  Jennifer Lopez also once owned the estate, which checks off the necessary criteria of a celebrity home in Cali: a home gym and screening room, thick hedges shielding the pool from view, a 250-foot private driveway, and a gated entry to keep the paps at bay.  Simon Berlyn  The backyard area is also nicer than most tropical resorts, complete with an infinity pool, a full tennis court, chicken coop, detached guest house, and a playground for Stefani’s children. If you need further proof that Stefani lived here, just take in the statement outdoor pizza oven.  Simon Berlyn  Stephen Shapiro of Westside Estate Agency holds the listing.  See more photos below.

"""Elon Musk’s ‘Pedo’ Tweet Inquiry Answered: Thai Rescue Diver’s Lawyer Preps Lawsuit A lawyer representing the diver who Elon Musk recently accused of being a pedophile said on Wednesday that he sent the Tesla chief a letter that says that he’s preparing to file a libel lawsuit.  The development is the latest twist in the entrepreneur’s turbulent summer on Twitter and comes one day after Musk questioned why the diver hadn’t sued him if his claims were untrue.  “You don’t think it’s strange he hasn’t sued me? He was offered free legal services,” asked Musk in reply to @Yoda on Twitter.  Also Read: Elon Musk Needled for Tearful NY Times Interview About Having to Work Through His Birthday  Attorney L. Lin Wood, who is representing diver Vernon Unsworth, replied to the thread on Wednesday, saying that Musk “should check his mail before tweeting.”  Musk originally called Unsworth — a diver that criticized Musk’s attempts to help the Thai soccer team trapped in a cave as a “PR stunt” — a “pedo guy” in July. Musk later apologized for his comment, saying it was “spoken in anger.”  Also Read: Elon Musk Says He Won't Take Tesla Private After All  “You published three different tweets to your twenty-two million followers that Mr. Unsworth engages in the sexual exploitation of Thai children, and you did so at a time when he was working to save the lives of twelve Thai children,” Wood said in his letter, dated August 6, to Musk. “You did so without any basis.”  Wood added that he’s prepping a civil libel complaint against Musk.  A representative for Musk did not immediately respond to TheWrap’s request for comment.  Even without a potential civil suit on his hands, it’s already been a controversial month for 47-year-old entrepreneur. Musk is under the regulatory microscope after bringing Wall Street to a halt earlier this summer, tweeting he had “funding secured” to take Tesla private. Musk announced last Friday, after talking to shareholders, to keep Tesla a publicly traded company. Tesla shares have dropped about 20 percent to $305 a share since Musk tweeted about going private.""",/home/yanwang_nuist/dev_workspace/prj_python/fnd-bootstrap/dataset/gossip/Images/gossip_test/7jF3yXnKkINMjVvyDry4HHxf7VIf7uWM.jpg,1.0

Get push notifications with news, features and more.  Selena Gomez, 25, and The Weeknd, 27, have ended their relationship, multiple sources confirm to PEOPLE exclusively.  “She and Abel have been going back and forth for a few months about their relationship,” says an insider. “It’s been hard with him being on tour and her shooting in New York. That wasn’t easy on them.”  While Gomez “always made an effort” to attend his shows when she could, “that played a part in them getting distant,” adds the insider. “It’s over for now, but they’re still in touch.”  The breakup also hasn’t been easy on the couple. “It’s been hard for them to come to the realization that this is the direction things were heading, but it’s been hard for months,” says the insider, who adds that Gomez is not back together with her ex Justin Bieber.  Gomez was spotted spending time with Bieber — whom she dated on-and-off from 2011 to 2015 — over the weekend. The duo attended church together and were photographed by TMZ grabbing breakfast at a café in Westlake Village, California, in late October.  It’s been a challenging year for Gomez, who revealed in September that the reason she quietly stepped back from her career over the summer was because she was recovering from a kidney transplant.  WATCH: Selena Gomez and The Weeknd Split After 10 Months Together  The Weeknd and Gomez first became linked in January, when they were spotted sharing a kiss while out on a romantic dinner date. A source told PEOPLE at the time that the budding romance was “new and nothing serious.”  However, in the months that followed, the two would flaunt their status as the picture-perfect couple. Gomez and Weeknd traveled to Italy together shortly after and even took a trip to the “Earned It” singer’s hometown of Toronto, Canada, in March.  After a series of sweet outings, the stars made their official debut as a couple at the Met Gala. And, most importantly, Weeknd received a stamp of approval from Gomez’s mother, Mandy Teefey.  The whirlwind romance showed no signs of slowing down, with a source previously telling PEOPLE, “They’re doing great together. Abel treats Selena really well and he makes her very happy.”  In May, Gomez explained why she had opted to make her relationship so public.  “It’s really hard when I would want to spend so much time hiding things,” she said in an interview with On Air With Ryan Seacrest.  “It’s too much pressure, and I think everyone gets over everything eventually… I just want to be happy.

"""Justin Bieber Cancels Remaining ‘Purpose’ Tour Dates After 154 shows, Justin Bieber is bowing out of the remaining dates of his “Purpose” world tour, Variety has confirmed. According to a source, the pop star made the call on his own after much consideration. “It wasn’t a decision made overnight,” says an insider. “He’s had some time off and was able to consider his commitments.” To cancel the remainder of the tour, which was headed to Asia (Japan, Hong Kong, Philippines and Singapore) in addition to more U.S. dates (including an Aug. 5 performance at the Rose Bowl), was doable seeing as some tickets went on sale as recently as one week ago, so refunds will be available quickly.  Bieber’s 14 called off dates follow a similar move by Adele, who canceled the last two shows of her world tour scheduled for London’s Wembley Stadium, where 100,000 fans were expected nightly. “On medical advice I simply am unable to perform over the weekend,” she wrote in a post on Facebook. “To say I’m heart broken would be a complete understatement.”  Bieber has not yet commented on social media and reps for the singer were also unavailable for comment.  Through the first half of 2017, Bieber’s tour grossed $93.2 million with average per date ticket sales of 38,297, according to concert industry trade Pollstar. Bieber will likely face penalties for the U.S. dates, which are typically not insured against cancellation without a medical reason or a “Force Majeure,” which is defined as an unforeseeable circumstance that prevents someone from fulfilling a contract — like a war or political instability that could put an artist in danger.  A source confirms TMZ’s earlier story that Bieber was “just over it.” A reporter for the site caught up with Bieber on the beach in Santa Monica, California Monday afternoon. Bieber responded to questions by saying “Everything’s fine … I’ve been on tour for two years, [I’m going to spend time] resting, relaxation gonna ride some bikes.” Asked whether he had a message for his fans, he said “I love you guys, you’re awesome, I’m sorry for anyone who feels disappointed or betrayed.”  Update: A statement announcing the cancellation read:  “Due to unforeseen circumstances, Justin Bieber will cancel the remainder of the Purpose World Tour concerts. Justin loves his fans and hates to disappoint them. He thanks his fans for the incredible experience of the Purpose World Tour over last 18 months. He is grateful and honored to have shared that experience with his cast and crew for over 150 successful shows across six continents during this run. However, after careful consideration, he has decided he will not be performing any further dates. Tickets will be refunded at point of purchase.”""",/home/yanwang_nuist/dev_workspace/prj_python/fnd-bootstrap/dataset/gossip/Images/gossip_test/ktkDc1dAn7UAeAUPP3skjiLgbo1UEQch.jpg,0.0

"""Teresa Giudice & Husband Joe Spend Their Birthdays Apart as Source Says He Lost 45 Lbs. in Prison Teresa and Joe Giudice can’t wait to “be a family again,” a source tells PEOPLE.  This week, the Real Housewives of New Jersey couple celebrated their 46th birthdays apart while Joe serves out his 41-month sentence for mail, wire and bankruptcy fraud.  Joe, who transferred from the Federal Correctional Institution in Fort Dix, New Jersey, to a federal prison in Pennsylvania last November, has completed 27 months of his sentence thus far. Teresa served a little over 11 months in prison herself for the same crimes and was released on Dec. 23, 2015.  According to the source, the couple — who share daughters Gia, 17, Gabriella, 14, Milania, 12, and Audriana, 9 — “can’t wait to be reunited.”  “These last few years have been tough on everybody,” the insider adds.  Want to keep up with the latest from PEOPLE? Sign up for our daily newsletter to get our best stories of the day delivered straight to your inbox.  Nevertheless, both have held onto a positive outlook. Joe has lost 45 lbs. in prison and Teresa — who trimmed down with yoga during her own sentence — is spending plenty of time with her daughters as she takes care of the household.  “Joe is working out,” the source says. “Teresa is, too. They both look better than ever.”  To celebrate Teresa’s May 18 birthday, the Giudice daughters threw her a surprise party at the house with close friends and family.  “She was very surprised and had no idea,” the source says. “Joe called during the party and wished her a happy birthday.”  For Joe’s May 22 birthday, he called the house and all the girls sang happy birthday to him.  RELATED: Teresa Giudice: I ‘Wouldn’t Mind’ Moving to Italy If Joe Gets Deported After Prison Sentence  In January, Teresa’s lawyer told PEOPLE that rumors of trouble in the couple’s marriage are completely false.  “It’s extremely sad that there are actually people out there and semi-reputable media outlets who seem to take pleasure in perpetuating horrible rumors and fake news stories about this family,” said attorney James J. Leonard Jr. “Haven’t they been through enough? Haven’t the children suffered enough? People need to let this family live their lives. Enough is enough. No one is cheating, no one is getting divorced. The truth is they can’t wait to be together again.”  “These last few years have been very challenging and very difficult,” he added. “Both Joe and Teresa have each lost a parent, have both experienced incarceration and have both been without one another for long periods of time. I can tell you from having deeply personal conversations with both of them, what they want more than anything is to be together with one another and their children and move forward to brighter days as a family.”""",/home/yanwang_nuist/dev_workspace/prj_python/fnd-bootstrap/dataset/gossip/Images/gossip_test/Ng8moYZYWCWOMgiNYgGJY3vUrUBBCJDP.jpg,1.0
"""Selena Gomez's Mom Reportedly Isn't the Reason She and Justin Bieber Are Taking a Break Though Selena Gomez's mom, Mandy Teefey, hasn't exactly hidden the fact that she doesn't love her daughter's rollercoaster relationship with Justin Bieber, that disapproval is reportedly not the reason why Selena and Justin are rumored to currently be on a break. """"They're not on a break because of her relationship with her mom. They have their own issues and are always on and off,"""" a source told People about Jelena this week. """"[Selena] wouldn't base her relationship off of what her mom thinks."""" The insider added, """"They've been having disagreements, but it wouldn't be surprising if they're back together in a week.""""  Several outlets reported last week that the duo was spending some time apart, but People's source shares that they were definitely on good terms as recently as March 1, Justin's birthday, part of which they spent together. In honor of the special day, Selena appeared to post about Justin on Instagram for the first time since they reunited last fall: She shared a picture of herself with a Polaroid photo of someone who looks like JBiebs resting on her forehead, writing, """"March 1, 1994 someone I know that happens to be super cool was born. Boom.""""  Just a few days after Justin's b-day, he and Selena were spotted attending the same church service separately, according to People. As a source explained to E!, """"They were having a lot of little disagreements recently and one fight in particular blew up and caused them to decide to 'break up,' however, they've been in contact the entire time and their feelings for each other have not changed...They will absolutely get back together and they are not over, but they both need some time away from each other."""" Another E! source mentioned Selena's currently """"not amazing"""" relationship with her mother, but didn't explicitly link it to Justin and Selena's decision to take a short break.  Whether or not she's influenced the state of Selena's relationship, there's no doubt that Mandy isn't a Jelena stan. In aJanuary interview*, Mandy admitted that she's """"not happy"""" about her daughter's rekindled romance with the """"Sorry"""" singer, who Selena first started dating back in 2010. That said, Mandy shared that she would never deliberately come between Selena and Justin. """"Selena can live her life however she wants as long as she is happy, safe and healthy,"""" Mandy said.

"""Did Khloe Kardashian Reveal Her Baby’s Name?: See The Hilarious Tweet That Has Fans Shook Did Khloe Kardashian just let her daughter’s name slip, with the help of Andy Cohen?! Check out this conversation between the two that has fans buzzing!  We always knew Andy Cohen, 49, was great friends with the Kardashian family. However, we didn’t know they were so close that Khloe Kardashian, 33, would name her first child after the Bravo host! Well, it’s a joke, but a clever joke at that, that had fans in a tizzy during a Twitter exchange on April 8. “Can’t wait to meet baby Andy! (That’s the name right?!),” Andy tweeted at Khloe while discussing The Real Housewives of Atlanta. “I mean, I was going to surprise you but you guessed her name,” Khloe replied, clearly joking that she’s already planned to name her baby after Andy. While we wish this was a legitimate reveal, Khloe continues to keep us guessing. Check out their playful conversation below!  The conversation started when Khloe tweeted that part 1 of the RHOA reunion was “just too good,” before thanking Andy for yet another juicy broadcast. The Bravo host then told Khloe she has “an OPEN invite” to the reunion [which is three parts]. Khloe said she would totally be there, however, the “only thing” holding her back is that she’s “about to give birth.” — Which leads up to the most recent report involving her pregnancy.  Khloe is reportedly in labor, according to TMZ on April 9. While we do know that the Good American designer is in Cleveland, patiently waiting for the arrival of her daughter with boyfriend, Tristan Thompson, 27, nothing else has been confirmed involving the birth. Adding to the speculation, Kylie Jenner‘s, OB/GYN, Dr. Thais Aliabadi, posted a photo of herself traveling for work over the weekend. The interesting timing of her flight had fans buzzing that she was traveling to Cleveland to assist with Khloe’s delivery; Since the Keeping Up With The Kardashians star is due to give birth any day now.  Khloe and Tristan are expecting their first child together, a baby girl, which they announced on December 20, 2017. Khloe’s baby shower took place on March 10 in CA, where her family and friends, including Kim Zolciak-Biermann, 39, and her daughter, Brielle, 21, were both present. The celebration was had a pink theme, respectively, and was filled with lavish flowers and table settings.

"""Are David Beckham & Victoria Beckham Getting a Divorce?

Email Terms & Privacy Notice By submitting your email, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Notice and to receive email correspondence from us.  So, are the Beckhams divorcing? Rumors about trouble in David and Victoria’s marriage have been proliferating in the tabloids since the Royal Wedding, where the couple was photographed looking dour. Of course, there are always rumors about the Beckhams, who will (hopefully?) celebrate their 19th wedding anniversary on July 4. This time, though, social-media participants seem convinced that they are really heading for a split.  There are a few factors to consider when weighing the possibility of divorce. One is: Do you care? Another is: What have the Beckhams said about their marriage? (It’s F-I-N-E, according to their publicist, who called the rumors “Journalist Chinese whispers and fake news fueled by social media.”) And another is: What’s going on with the Beckhams’ businesses?  Last week, the Daily Mail reported that David left his longtime manager, who also manages Posh, for a new team led by his friend David Gardner. This, to me, would be the strongest sign of an impending split, but the Beckhams quickly denied the report. Then, Victoria gave a speech at the Forbes Women Summit in New York, where she mentioned David specifically and called him an “incredible husband.”  “I try really, really hard. I try hardest to be the best mother,” she said in her speech, according to People. “I am trying to be the best wife and the best professional. When I get home I try to put the phone down and spend time with the children and spend time with David. I have the support of an incredible husband. We really are equal with everything we do at home with the children. When I’m away he’s the one doing the school run and doing the cooking.”  So Victoria is trying. Is David? So far, he hasn’t personally said anything about the divorce rumors. I’d wait to see what he does next week for their anniversary.  In other celebrity relationship news, Ben Affleck and Lindsay Shookus are doing great. Shookus’s parents visited the couple in L.A. this past weekend, and they all went on a dinner date and a hike the next day. (Shookus’s 5-year-old daughter was present for the hike, too.) According to an “eyewitness” who talked to People, Affleck was in a “great mood” at dinner, and he “picked up the check at the end of the night.”  Photo: Juliano-rol/X17online.com  But Affleck and Shookus are not necessarily getting more serious, according to Entertainment Tonight. A source close to Affleck told the outlet, “Ben knows he loves Lindsay, but he wants to take things slow for the sake of his sobriety. He’s actually been told to take it slow and he’s heeding that advice … Ben isn’t ready to propose and has no plans to get engaged anytime soon, but Lindsay feels he is worth the wait.”  What do you think? Is Ben Affleck worth the wait?  Moving more quickly is Shookus’s SNL colleague Pete Davidson, who just moved into a $16 million apartment in Manhattan with his new fiancé, Ariana Grande. Grande’s 25th birthday is today, and Davidson wished her a happy birthday on Instagram just after midnight.  Last night, Grande posted a photo of Davidson on her Instagram story at 11:11 p.m. with the caption, “i have no wish i have everything i ever wanted hi.” I love it!  Do you remember who Chris Martin is dating? It’s Dakota Johnson. They were photographed walking a dog in Malibu on Sunday.  Photo: DOBN/RMBI/BACKGRID  One small blessing from this week:  Martin’s ex-wife, Gwyneth Paltrow, is preparing to marry her fiancé, the television producer Brad Falchuk at the end of the summer. Here’s what she had to say about wedding planning this time around:  “I’m very busy so I’m actually not that involved in it.”  Photo: XPOS/BACKGRID  And here’s an interesting blind item from this week, from Enty at Crazy Days and Nights:  “This former A- list mostly television actress from a now defunct hit comedy is probably A-/B+ list mostly movie actress. She says that this A-/B+ list writer/actor all of you know spent three weeks chatting her up and doing everything he could to hook up with her. She finally hooked up with him and within 30 minutes after, he had her out the door and has ghosted her since.”  I believe that “A-/B+ list writer/actor all of you know” has moved on with an even younger actress.  Finally, I’ll leave you with some incredible news: Emma Watson is back together with former Glee star Chord Overstreet. Or perhaps they never broke up? They first announced their relationship back in March, with a very obvious pap stroll in L.A.. Then, People reported at the end of May that they were over. But last week, they were pap-strolling in L.A. again, and this time, they made out for the camera! Watson must really like this guy to go along with all of this.

"""Catherine Oxenberg Is Writing a Book About the Group She Claims 'Brainwashed' Her Daughter Three months after first revealing the story of her daughter India’s involvement with the group NXIVM, Dynasty star Catherine Oxenberg has decided to write a book to share her story with the hope it can also help others.  Her memoir, CAPTIVE: A Mother’s Crusade to Save Her Daughter From a Terrifying Cult, cowritten by PEOPLE contributor Natasha Stoynoff, will be released in Fall and will recount Catherine’s estrangement from her 26-year-old daughter, India, and her attempt to rescue her from what she believes is a dangerous group.  “I was completely ignorant about these sorts of the dangers and traps associated with these so-called personal growth self help groups. It’s an $11 billion, completely unregulated industry, so I reached out to a lot of experts for guidance,” Catherine tells PEOPLE. “What I learned along the way could help others [and] prevent them from falling into the same trap, know what warning signs to look for, and also to give hope to those parents that are struggling and who have lost children to similar situations.  “So many people reached out to me when I went public saying, ‘Oh my God, I’m in the same situation. I’m heartbroken, I’ve lost my child. I don’t know what to do,” she adds.  Image zoom Allison Michael Orenstein  India was 20 years old when she and her mother attended a meeting as part of a leadership seminar organized by NXIVM in 2011. While the meeting was supposed to provide methods for self-improvement, Catherine told PEOPLE she found the organization “weird and creepy.” India didn’t have the same hesitations and immersed herself in the organization over the next few years.  NXIVM has been around for 20 years, with approximately 16,000 people paying thousands of dollars for experiences like executive-coaching workshops. Run by Keith Raniere, 57, who is known as “Vanguard” to members, NXIVM has offices throughout the country and in Mexico.  Image zoom Catherine and daughter India Wenn/Alamy  “The mission of NXIVM is to help transform and, ultimately, be an expression of the noble civilization of humans,” the organization states on their website.  Not only do former followers dispute this claim, many have shared horror stories of allegedly having their skin branded with Rainere’s initials and describe the group as a “cult.”  Last April, Catherine claims she learned her daughter was also in potential danger.  Her friend, Bonnie Piesse, 34, had left the group and warned Catherine that India was taking part in what Catherine calls a “secret sisterhood.”  “You need to save your daughter,” Piesse told her, according to Catherine. “You need to save India.”  In December, the New York Times reported that Justice Department has opened an investigation into NXIVM.  Image zoom Catherine and young daughter India Ron Galella/WireImage  But that doesn’t ease Catherine’s immediate concerns for her daughter.  Catherine previously told PEOPLE that she learned India was on a restrictive diet, suffered hair loss, and hadn’t had her period in a year. Now she says she’s told that India is eating more because “they’re trying to look more normal,” but says she’s still worried.  After Catherine decided to go public with her allegations in October, India became angry and further withdrew from her. Catherine tells PEOPLE that India was recently in Los Angeles, but wasn’t willing to see her.  “She was in L.A. and I was hoping that was a good sign, and I was very distressed when she flew back [to NXIVM’s headquarters Albany],” Catherine says. “Even is she’s not willing to see me, the fact that she’s outside of their sphere of influence physically gave me hope.”  “I’m assuming they kept her on a tight leash so that they still had a lot of influence over her,” she says. “Because if she [leaves the group], that’s a tremendous blow to [NXIVM] considering she’s been such a public figure for them. I think that that could be the death blow and I think they’re doing everything they can to keep her in.”  As India becomes more entangled in the controversial group, Catherine is writing the memoir in another attempt to save India.  CAPTIVE will reveal the steps Catherine has taken to extract her daughter from what she considers a “dangerous, mind-controlling cult” in which she claims the women are treated like “slaves.” She also draws on interviews from former members and cult experts.  “I’ve grown as a person through this experience [and] I’ve become more inclusive,” Catherine says. “It’s no longer just about my daughter. It’s about helping everybody who has suffered through this.”""",/home/yanwang_nuist/dev_workspace/prj_python/fnd-bootstrap/dataset/gossip/Images/gossip_test/ByoT9h3UxBrJdBH7zRaigXvaOKp7gLRr.jpg,1.0
"""Taylor Swift Spent Her Fourth of July in Turks and Caicos with Boyfriend Joe Alwyn Is it even a proper Independence Day celebration without fireworks, Stars and Stripes face paint, and photos from one of Taylor Swift's infamous Fourth of July parties? Yes it is, but still the Internet had to do without the latter in 2018, because this was the second year in a row that her home in Watch Hill, Rhode Island was empty on America's birthday. (In other words, perhaps Taylor not celebrating the 4th during Trump's presidency is her biggest political statement yet?)  Instead of holding one of her #squad-powered summer bashes this year, T-Swift chose to spend a break from her current world tour in Turks and Caicos with her boyfriend actor Joe Alwyn.  The couple were spotted all loved up and canoodling on the beach and in the clear tropical waters. And yes, while Swift abandoned America to vacation a British territory islands with her British beau, she was spotted sporting a red, blue, and white striped bikini from swimwear brand Solid and Striped. America represent! 🇺🇸  The Jamie Top solidandstriped.com $88.00 Shop Now  Taylor and Joe allegedly first met at the 2016 Met Gala, but their ~relationship status~ wasn't confirmed until a year later in May 2017. A source tells People, """"Joe is just an amazing boyfriend. He is very supportive. Taylor adores his family. She’s in a very good place.""""  On the few occasions they have been spotted together in public, the couple have always looked like they're absolutely crazy about each other, but have made sure to hide their love from the public eye as much as possible. In fact, these photos mark the first time Taylor and Joe have been spotted together since their lunch date in North London over a month ago. In other words then, this is a far cry from those seemingly-posed, definitely cheesy beach pics with her (also British) ex Tom Hiddleston.  Well the two certainly look like they're having a lovely time on their little beach getaway, soaking in some sun and snorkeling and hopefully enjoying colorful cocktails too.

"""Taylor Swift's Original Ex-Boyfriend Lyric in """"Gorgeous"""" Is Telling Taylor Swift's """"Gorgeous"""" is about her new boyfriend Joe Alwyn, Swift confirmed to her fans, but a certain ex also makes a lyrical guest appearance. In the released song, the lyric is """"I've got a boyfriend/He's older than us/He's in the club doing I don't know what,"""" which led some to believe the line was about Calvin Harris (DJ, who's 33) or Tom Hiddleston (British actor, 36, the last boyfriend Swift was with before getting with Alwyn; she dated Hiddleston immediately after Harris.)  But in a new behind-the-scenes, making of the song video that AT&T released today, Swift sings her original lyrics for the song. She toys with the """"I've got a boyfriend"""" line for a bit, and, during one song-writing session, seems keen on this lyric, which leads into the """"You're so gorgeous"""" chorus:  I’ve got a boyfriend/he’s older than us/I haven’t seen him in a couple of months/I go through phases when it comes to love/I’m nothing that you want, but I must say you're so gorgeous...  Watch it at the 3:00 mark:  At first glance, this could suggest the ex Swift is singing about is Harris; the two spent a lot of their relationship apart because of Swift touring for 1989 and Harris playing DJ gigs around the world. Swift went to the Met Gala, the night she and Hiddleston hit it off, alone.  But Swift dated Hiddleston right before being seen for the first time with Alwyn in October 2016.

If this original """"Gorgeous"""" lyric really is inspired by Hiddleston, it may have been that the flame the two had also burned out (perhaps Hiddleston's alleged thirst for publicity extinguished it), and Swift moved on.""",/home/yanwang_nuist/dev_workspace/prj_python/fnd-bootstrap/dataset/gossip/Images/gossip_test/OPtWZdRrXg3rECf39lV6mBnElAWA3Ddb.jpg,1.0
"""Angelina Jolie bonds with Jon Voight over family dinner Brad Pitt worked behind the scenes to reunite Angelina Jolie and her father Jon Voight following one of Hollywood's most bitter family feuds.  And while Brangelina may be no more, it seems the once-strained father-daughter relationship Brad helped repair is finally flourishing.  Angelina and her father were pictured on a rare outing in Beverly Hills on Wednesday.  Healing: Angelina Jolie bonds with the father she once despised as Jon Voight joins her for dinner with the children  Bonding: Angelina's famous father Jon Voight joined her for dinner in Beverly Hills  The two took four of Angelina's six children - Pax, Zahara, Vivienne, and Knox - to a sushi restaurant for dinner.  As always, Angelina, 41, was dressed in black - in this case a long flowing black net skirt with a scoop neck bodysuit up top.  Her hair was worn half tied back, and sunglasses shade her eyes as she walked from the family's luxury vehicle to the building with her children.  Classic Ange: As always, Angelina, 41, was dressed in black - in this case a long flowing black net skirt with a scoop neck body beneath  Little Vivienne carried a large stuffed animal and wore her hair in pigtails as she walked to the restaurant with her twin brother and two older siblings. Shiloh and Maddox were not seen.  Jon, who wore a shirt and jacket, completed the family group.  It is still rare that the 78-year-old is seen with his grandchildren, following the end of his six-and-a-half year estrangement from Angelina.  The star still best known for his appearance in the 1969 movie Midnight Cowboy split from wife Marcheline Bertrand when their daughter was only an infant, with the two divorcing by the time Angelina turned four.  Family dinner: The father and daughter took her children Pax, Zahara, Vivienne, and Knox to a sushi restaurant for dinner  Family ties: It is still rare that the 78-year-old is seen with his grandchildren, following his six-and-a-half year estrangement from Angelina  Jon and Angelina had only sporadic contact during her childhood, yet in her early TV and film work she still used her full name of Angelina Jolie Voight.  But, perhaps because she did not want to be seen as trading on her father's fame, she had dropped the Voight in favour of her middle name by the time she appeared as Lara Croft, a female version of Indiana Jones.  It is not known what caused her to fall out with Voight, who played her father Lord Croft in the movie.  Twins: Vivienne and Knox carry bags as they leave the restaurant; the logo is from the fancy Beverly Hills Hotel  Strained relationship: Jon and Angelina had only sporadic contact during her childhood  Single mother: Pax follows Angelina out of the building  Sisters: Zahara and Vivienne are pictured heading back to their car  By July 2002, however, she was applying to have her non-acting name legally changed to Angelina Jolie, losing the Voight.  The following month, Voight gave an interview on U.S. television in which he claimed his daughter, who had just adopted a Cambodian boy named Maddox, had 'serious mental problems'.  'I'm broken-hearted... because I've been trying to reach my daughter and get her help, and I have failed and I'm sorry,' he said.  'Really I haven't come forward and addressed the serious mental problems she has spoken about so candidly to the press over the years, but I've tried behind the scenes in every way.'  Patched up: Voight repeatedly tried to regain contact with his daughter, particularly after her mother's death from cancer in 2007; Pax and Zahara are seen at dinner  Angelina responded by cutting off her father completely, saying that, as a new mother, she did not think it was healthy to associate with him.  In an interview a year later, she said Voight's comments were damaging because they could have affected her relationship with Maddox.

"""Miranda Lambert and Blake Shelton had an affair, her ex claims It seems Blake Shelton may have a thing or two to learn about karma himself.

"""Leonardo DiCaprio Star in, Produce ‘The Black Hand’ – Variety Leonardo DiCaprio will star in and produce an adaptation of Stephan Talty’s book “The Black Hand” for Paramount Pictures.  The true story about the origins of the mafia in America follows Joe Petrosino — nicknamed the “Italian Sherlock Holmes” — an NYPD cop who goes after the ruthless gang in the early 190os. The thugs (with the calling card black hand) migrated from Italy to America, and kidnapped people to extort money from their families. They were loathed by law-abiding Italian families who were frightened, but nevertheless helped Petrosino behind the scenes.  Ellen Goldsmith-Vein and Jeremy Bell of The Gotham Group will produce. DiCaprio’s producing partner, Jennifer Davisson, will also produce with Gotham, as well as Nathaniel Posey on behalf of his Appian Way Productions.  Talty is the New York Times-bestselling author of six nonfiction books focused on history and individual achievement. As a ghostwriter, Talty’s work includes “A Captain’s Duty,” which was the basis for the 2013 Oscar-nominated Tom Hanks-starrer “Captain Phillips.”  DiCaprio recently starred in “Before the Flood,” the 2016 documentary about climate change directed by Fisher Stevens. He will next play Sam Phillips, a pioneer in the music industry during the 1950s who helped launch the careers of Elvis Presley, Johnny Cash, and Jerry Lee Lewis.  Paramount has been busy acquiring material for DiCaprio following his new first-look deal, which he signed in 2015. Appain Way is developing a reboot of the “Captain Planet” series with Glen Powell, among its many projects.  DiCaprio is repped by LBI Entertainment.

"""All the Members of the British Royal Family, Ranked by Net Worth At 91 years old, Queen Elizabeth II has a laundry list of accolades to her name, including the world’s longest-ruling and oldest monarch. She’s also the richest member of the British royal family — by a long shot.  Royal family finances can be complicated, as many details of their fortune are kept private. But it’s fair to say that Queen Elizabeth and the royal family’s net worth is in the tens of billions — around $88 billion as of 2017, according to Forbes. Since the royal family’s jobs aren’t like the average person, how do they make all their money? The short answer: much of the royal family lives off trusts like the Crown Estate, which is owned by the reigning monarch and includes real estate properties like Buckingham Palace.  Daily Money Sign up to receive the latest updates and the smartest advice. View Sample Sign Up Now  Some of the royal family’s wealth also comes from a portfolio of extravagant personal collections. The British monarchy owns billions of dollars in property alone, including Balmoral Castle, where the Queen spends every summer, The Savoy in London, a horse racetrack and an entire London street. The crown also owns one of the largest art collections in the world and the Crown Jewels collection, which is made up of more than 140 individual pieces and estimated to be worth at least $4 billion.  Royal obsession, which neared fever pitch this spring as the world prepared for the arrival of Kate Middleton’s third baby, Prince Louis Arthur Charles, and the marriage of Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex and Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, is thought to generate approximately £1.8 billion, or about $2.5 billion, for the U.K. economy every year. (That number is likely even higher this year because of Prince Harry and Meghan’s May wedding.)  Here’s what you need to know about each member of the royal family’s net worth:  Queen Elizabeth II net worth  Queen Elizabeth II visits the Royal College Of Physicians on February 20, 2018 in London, England. Chris Jackson—Getty Images Chris Jackson—Getty Images  Queen Elizabeth II enjoys a number of royal perks — particularly her substantial wealth. The 91-year-old Queen Elizabeth’s net worth is estimated to be at least $520 million by Wealth-X, a global wealth insights firm. The firm also estimated the royal family’s net worth (Prince Philip and their children) to land at least $1.1 billion.  The queen’s net worth comes in part from a percentage of profits generated by the Crown Estate, which earned about £328.8 million pounds, or $459.25 million, in the 2016-2017 calendar year, according to its annual report. Queen Elizabeth gets a percentage of that profit — called the “Sovereign Grant” — which is set to increase from 15% to 25% over the next 10 years, in part to pay for renovations at Buckingham Palace that will be completed over the next decade. The queen also collects a salary from the Duchy of Lancaster, which is separate from the Crown Estate and is a private and independent income reserved for the Duke of Lancaster, which is the queen.  Queen Elizabeth also owns real estate like the $140 million Balmoral Castle, a holiday home for the Royal Family that is featured on the back of Scotland’s £100 notes, and the $65 million Sandringham House in the English countryside, which the Queen inherited from her father. Both of these are private properties that have stayed within the Royal Family for years and are not part of the Crown Estate or other estates associated with the crown.  Prince Philip net worth  Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh attends the 2017 Braemar Highland Gathering at The Princess Royal and Duke of Fife Memorial Park on September 2, 2017 in Braemar, Scotland. Samir Hussein—Samir Hussein/WireImage Samir Hussein—Samir Hussein/WireImage  Prince Philip — Queen Elizabeth’s husband of 70 years and the Duke of Edinburgh — also enjoys the wealth and perks that come with being a member of the royal family. While WealthX did not provide a net worth for Prince Philip, it has been reported it falls around $30 million.  Under the Sovereign Grant Act of 2011, Prince Philip received an annual Parliamentary annuity of £359,000 pounds, or around $500,234, “to meet the expenses of carrying out his public duties in support of the Queen.” Those duties included attending public events alongside the queen and alone, as well as giving speeches. At an event in March 2016, Prince Philip once joked he was the “world’s most expensive plaque-unveiler.”  The Duke of Edinburgh retired from his royal position in August 2017 at the age of 96, with the “full support of the Queen,” the palace said in a statement at the time. His retirement from the role came after he was admitted to the hospital in the summer of 2017 as a “precautionary measure” due to a pre-existing condition, though Buckingham Palace did not provide specifics for his retirement.  Prince Charles net worth  Prince Charles, Prince of Wales meets local school children in the village of Ramsbury on December 15, 2017 in Marlborough, England. Anwar Hussein—WireImage Anwar Hussein—WireImage  Long the heir to the throne, Prince Charles’s net worth is estimated to be around $400 million, according to Wealth-X. Charles, also known as the Prince of Wales, makes most of his money through the Duchy of Cornwall, a private estate that funds the activities of whoever holds the title of Prince of Wales and his family.  Between March 2016 to March 2017, Prince Charles received £16.6 million, or $22.9 million, from the Duchy of Cornwall, according to the estate’s most recent financial statement. The Duchy of Cornwall has £1 billion, or $1.3 billion, in total assets. The estate itself owns a vast amount of land and real estate, predominately in southwest England, including cottages, countryside homes, barn conversions, sea-side estates and even some properties available for rent.  The Duchy of Cornwall was established in 1337 by Edward II with the intention of providing an income to the future Princes of Wales. The estate currently funds not only Prince Charles’ expenses but also those of his family, which includes Prince Charles, his wife Camilla, and his sons Prince William and Prince Harry and their wives Kate, Duchess of Cambridge and Meghan, Duchess of Sussex.  Once married to the late Princess Diana, mother to both Prince William and Prince Harry, Prince Charles has donated his wealth over the years to charities and aid projects through the Prince of Wales’s Charitable Foundation. The organization has awarded more than £52 million, or $72.5 million, in grants over the last 10 years, according to the charity’s website. Prince Charles’s charity halved its donations in the most recently reported year, giving £3.1 million, or $4.3 million, in 2017, compared to £7.7 million, or $10.7 million, in 2016, according to The Guardian.  One of the most recent beneficiaries of the foundation was Tusk, an organization founded to challenge poaching in Africa, which Prince William and Prince Harry worked with before.  Prince William net worth  Britain's Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, at the 2018 Centrepoint Awards at Kensington Palace on February 8, 2018 in London, England. WPA Pool—Getty Images WPA Pool—Getty Images  Prince William and Prince Harry have similar net worths, having both inherited the fortune amassed by their late mother, Princess Diana. Both brothers are believed to be worth somewhere between $25 and $40 million, according to Business Insider.  The two brothers each reportedly received the inheritance from their mother in a lump sum of approximately £10 million ($14 million) when they turned 30 years old, Koenig said. They also each started receiving dividends of $450,000 each year upon turning 25, according to Forbes.  William and Harry do not have to pay for official expenses related to their royal duties, such as travel for official visits, staff costs and wardrobe, which are are all financed by The Duchy of Cornwall. In 2017, the Duchy reported spending $4.9 million total to cover the official duties of Harry, Meghan, William and Kate, expenses that are paid in part through the Duchy’s annual revenue.  Prince William, who is second in line to the throne after his father, used to receive an annual salary of $62,000 for his work as an East Anglian Air Ambulance pilot, which he used to donate to charity, according to CNBC. He retired from his job flying rescue helicopters last summer to focus more on his royal duties.  Prince Harry net worth  Duchess of Sussex and Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex wave as they leave Windsor Castle after their wedding to attend an evening reception at Frogmore House, hosted by the Prince of Wales on May 19, 2018 in Windsor, England. Steve Parsons - WPA Pool/Getty Images  Prince Harry’s net worth is similar to his brother’s, in part because they both inherited the same amount of money from Princess Diana’s estate. Harry’s wealth is estimated to be at least $25 million, according to Wealth-X, though other estimates put Prince Harry’s net worth as high as $40 million.  Like his brother and sister-in-law, Prince Harry gets to save the majority of his inheritance because The Duchy of Cornwall covers the same expenses. Both Prince Harry and Prince William also inherited Princess Diana’s private jewels, though their value is not known, according to Koenig.  Prince Harry served in the Royal Air Force for 10 years, working his way up to captain, and making about $53,000 a year, Forbes reports. He retired from service in 2015, saying he wanted to devote more time to philanthropic work like the Invictus Games, which hosts international adaptive sports competitions for injured veterans.  He wed American actress Meghan Markle in May at Windsor Castle, and experts estimated their wedding cost about as much Will and Kate’s 2011 nuptials — around $34 million, mainly due to the security needed for the high-profile event.  Kate Middleton net worth  Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, greets members of the crowd as she visits The Fire Station, one of Sunderland's most iconic buildings, on February 21, 2018 in Sunderland, England. Chris Jackson—Getty Images Chris Jackson—Getty Images  Kate Middleton, who became the Duchess of Cambridge after marrying Prince William in April 2011, also has official royal expenses covered by the Duchy of Cornwall. Kate’s personal net worth is believed to be somewhere around $10 million, Business Insider reported, though the exact number is not known.  Although Kate is the first person outside a royal bloodline to join the royal family, her finances are anything but common. Middleton’s family runs a successful online mail-order party supply store, Party Pieces. Koenig says her parents, Michael and Carole Middleton, have been reported to be worth somewhere between $30 to $50 million, though the exact amount is not known.  “There is no way in knowing if the Duchess’ parents have set up trusts for their three children,” she said. But we can assume that Kate and her two siblings, Pippa and James Middleton, will inherit their parents money eventually, she said.  Kate has three children with William — Prince George, 4, and Princess Charlotte, 2, and Prince Louis, a boy who was born on April 23.  Meghan Markle net worth  Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex and Meghan, Duchess of Sussex travel in the Ascot Landau Carriage during their carriage procession after their wedding on May 19, 2018 in Windsor, England. Among the guests were 2200 members of the public, the royal family and Ms. Markle's Mother, Doria Ragland. Nick Edwards - WPA Pool/Getty Images  Meghan Markle, who became the Duchess of Sussex after marrying Prince Harry this year, may have the smallest bank account of her new (royal) family, but she’s still done well for herself with an estimated net worth of $5 million.  Most of Meghan’s net worth comes from her acting career before her 2017 engagement to Prince Harry. Meghan was paid $50,000 per episode on Suits, making her annual salary for the USA Network drama around $450,000, according to Fortune, but she left the show when she moved to the U.K. to live with Prince Harry. Meghan earned additional income from smaller film roles throughout her acting career.  The 36-year-old former Suits actress receives the same financial perks as her new sister-in-law, Kate. Meghan’s expenses related to all official royal business, including wardrobe, are paid for by the Duchy of Cornwall.  Despite only being married in May, Meghan has already joined Prince Harry for numerous royal engagements and begun her official royal duties. She has said she wants to dive into charity work through the Royal Foundation, having previously worked on United Nations campaigns for women’s rights.  Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis net worths  Princess Charlotte of Cambridge and Prince George of Cambridge look on from the balcony during the annual Trooping The Colour parade at the Mall on June 17, 2017 in London, England. Karwai Tang—WireImage Karwai Tang—WireImage  At just 4, 2 and less than a year old Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis are destined for a life of wealth and royalty.  Prince William and Kate Middleton’s first two children both already have relatively lavish lives — they attend two of the most impressive, and expensive, preschools in London. Prince George, who is third in line for the throne, attends Thomas’s Battersea — a $24,000-a-year- preschool that is touted as “the best English education money can buy.” Fourth in line for the throne, Princess Charlotte goes to the Willcocks Nursery School, a female-run preschool with a $14,000-a-year tuition.  Both Prince George and Princess Charlotte are expected to have a large impact on the British economy, according to branding valuation company Brand Finance, CNNMoney reported. Princess Charlotte is expected to have inspired $5 billion in economic activity while Prince George is expected to generate $3.6 billion, according to Brand Finance. Prince Louis is expected to generate a bit less than his older siblings, somewhere between $70-125 million within the first few weeks of his life, according to U.K-based research firms.

Hefner, the American icon who in 1953 introduced the world to Playboy magazine and built the company into one of the most recognizable American global brands in history, peacefully passed away today from natural causes at his home, The Playboy Mansion, surrounded by loved ones.”  Hefner’s son Cooper, who is also the Chief Creative Officer of Playboy Enterprises, also released a statement.  “My father lived an exceptional and impactful life as a media and cultural pioneer and a leading voice behind some of the most significant social and cultural movements of our time in advocating free speech, civil rights and sexual freedom. He defined a lifestyle and ethos that lie at the heart of the Playboy brand, one of the most recognizable and enduring in history. He will be greatly missed by many, including his wife Crystal, my sister Christie and my brothers David and Marston, and all of us at Playboy Enterprises,” said Cooper.

"""Is Bradley Cooper Really Singing in A Star Is Born? Bradley Cooper made his directorial debut in A Star Is Born alongside Lady Gaga in October. The musical, a remake of the 1970s drama starring Barbra Streisand (also a remake of the 1937 and 1954 versions) chronicles the life of a small-town girl who moves to the big city to become a star. Cooper plays Jackson Maine, a has-been rock singer with an alcohol problem, to Gaga's Ally, the talented small-town girl in question. The plot mostly stays true to the original, showcasing the pitfalls and inevitable romance between Jackson and Ally along her rise to stardom.  Cooper opened up about his experience shooting the film in April, telling Vulture, """"[Gaga] said right from the beginning that there would be a barter. [She said] 'I'm gonna rely on you to get a performance that's honest out of me' [...] 'and I'm gonna make sure that you're going to turn into a musician. Because we're going to sing everything live.' And I went, 'Wait, what?'""""  That's correct: Bradley Cooper will be singing live in the movie! Gaga reportedly told the 43-year-old actor that she wasn't a fan of movie stars lip-syncing to a prerecorded song in films. """"She's right!"""" he agreed. """"[Singing live] was terrifying, and I really relied on her. I spent about a year and a half taking vocal lessons and preparing."""" Even though the movie took only 42 days to shoot, Cooper revealed it took three years for him to fully get into character.  ADVERTISEMENT  """"The broken love story in A Star Is Born kept haunting me. Shots kept coming into my head. I would dream about it. I realized I had to [direct it], whether it fails or not,"""" he shared. """"I knew I had to try, and I wound up absolutely loving it. You can't hide when you sing. The best way to express love is through singing and music. I knew if I could marry that in a way, it would be special.""""  The film premiered on Oct. 5, so run to the nearest theater to get a taste of Cooper's singing for yourself. To be totally honest?

"""The eight-hour diet Nicole Kidman swears by The eight-hour diet is the latest health craze to hit Hollywood and fitness gurus are raving about its benefits.  The programme is based on only eating within a window of eight hours per day, and fasting for the other 16 to kick the body into fat burning mode.  Nicole Kidman and Hugh Jackman are said to be fans of the diet, eating breakfast at 10am and having their last meal of the day before 6pm.  Australian nutritionist, Lee Holmes, spoke to FEMAIL about the benefits of the eight-hour diet and discusses whether or not it really works.  Advertisement  """"The idea of intermittent fasting may seem foreign, impossible and even scary to some but, I've got a secret for you! It's something you do every. Single. Day,"""" Lee said.  Over the past few months, fitness gurus and nutrition professionals have been raving about the benefits of the eight hour diet. Photo / Getty Images  """"As soon as you drift off to sleep at night until the moment you open your eyes in the morning, you've been doing intermittent fasting. They don't call it break-fast for nothing because essentially you're breaking the fast when you eat your first meal in the morning.""""  Lee said the easiest way to begin fasting is to increase the time after your last meal in the evening and your breakfast in the morning.  """"By practicing fasting, you allow your body and gut time to digest, rest and heal. Fasting lightens the load on the gut, allowing it to work at its optimum. It also improves the cleansing process,"""" Lee said.  """"New research is beginning to demonstrate that intermittent fasting can increase the speed of cell recycling and regeneration, which reduces inflammation in the body. This means we can get sick less, experience less pain and become less susceptible to diseases.""""  Fasting can also help kick-start weight loss and repair the body, while reducing blood pressure and increasing energy.  """"But don't be fooled! Just because you're fasting, it doesn't mean you'll go hungry! If you eat satiating, delicious whole foods, you won't be hungry throughout the day - think good fats and protein sources instead of low-calorie junk food,"""" Lee said.  Acknowledging that the diet may not be for everyone, as it can be tough to stick too, she also added that those who have suffered from an eating disorder in the past should not try it.""",/home/yanwang_nuist/dev_workspace/prj_python/fnd-bootstrap/dataset/gossip/Images/gossip_test/RD3YtlPsl2qxQrd2jfXCBb12nlqLgT1c.jpg,1.0
"""Jermaine Dupri on Rumors He Rekindled Relationship with Janet Jackson (UPDATE) Shortly after Janet Jackson filed for divorce from Wissam Al-Mana, whispers of a reunion between the singer and ex, Jermaine Dupri, began making headlines. While some reports claim the pair are definitely back together, the So So Def producer recently revealed that it’s actually nothing more than wishful thinking on behalf of their fans, according to The Jasmine Brand.  “All of this is a speculation I guess when someone gets single. The fans actually really want to see us back together, so people have been championing this, but none of this is actually true,” Dupri admits. “I dated Janet damn near 10 years. I don’t have to hide. Why would I sneak around with someone that y’all know that I been with? I know her better than the man she met.”  Learn more about their rumored romance below.  ORIGINAL STORY: 9/26/2017  Janet Jackson’s marriage to Wissam Al-Mana was short-lived but reportedly still full of drama. In fact, her brother Randy Jackson claims the billionaire businessman was verbally and emotionally abusive to his younger sister, prompting their separation just weeks after the birth of their son, Eissa.  Reportedly, Jackson’s ex Jermaine Dupri has been a shoulder to lean on, and the two have reconnected after eight years apart.  According to sources at Bossip, “Things have been heating back up between the former couple, who have recently reunited and not just for music making purposes.”  The pair dated from 2001 until 2009, with Janet having this to say after confirming their split: “Jermaine is one of my best friends. I love him to death. We’re still connected. We’re still good friends. We still talk.”  The So So Def founder spoke on his past relationship with the ageless beauty in 2016, saying he knows Janet entered his life for a reason, according to TheJasmineBrand.  “I believe that my life is a definition of a journey and inside that journey there were supposed to be things that happen and me having a relationship with her [Janet] I definitely know it was part of my life that I was thought a lot for these 8 yrs and I look at it like that.  He went on to say, “I don’t know if it was supposed to stay, but it was supposed to come into my life and teach me what I have learned.

"""Ben Affleck's History With Alcohol Addiction: A Timeline of the Actor's Struggles and Road to Recovery Ben Affleck has returned to rehab as he continues to struggle with sobriety.  Jennifer Garner drove her estranged husband to an LA area facility on Wednesday afternoon, ET has learned. The 46-year-old actor knew he needed help and Garner was there for him, a source tells ET.  Affleck revealed in March 2017 that he had completed treatment for alcoholism in order to be """"the best father I can be,"""" but his history with addiction goes back much further. In fact, his experience with alcoholism began as a child, watching his own father, Timothy, battle the disease.  Affleck has opened up about his past with alcoholism from his family's cycle of addiction to his 2001 rehab stint.    1986: Parents' Divorce  """"To be honest with you, the marriage was so bad, and I remember feeling relief,"""" Affleck told Barbara Walters in a 2012 interview, reflecting on his parents' divorce when he was just 12 years old.  """"[My father] was an alcoholic... I did know that as a child. He drank a lot. My father was a -- what did they call him -- a real alcoholic. He, you know, drank all day, drank every day, and to his credit, he got sober ultimately,"""" he revealed. """"He's been sober for several decades, which I think is pretty impressive.""""  """"[He] turned his life around in a very laudable way,"""" the actor told The Daily Mail in 2008. """"But having such serious addiction issues has a major impact -- it colors who you are and becomes a part of you.""""  Though he considered his childhood difficult, Affleck said it was his friend, Matt Damon, and brother, Casey, that helped him deal with his father's alcoholism and parent's divorce.  """"I had good friends. I had Matt Damon, I had my brother, and I had a nucleus of friends that I grew up with and I had support from,"""" he told Walters.    1997: Managing Sobriety With Fame  It was a close collaboration with Damon that gained them both fame after 1997's Good Will Hunting -- shortly after which a 24-year-old Affleck stopped drinking.  """"I just wanted to stop. I started regretting some things I did when I was drunk. It's funny to be obnoxious or out of control, but then it's like, 'I think I hurt that person's feelings,' 'I made a fool of myself' or 'I didn't want to kiss that girl,'"""" he told a reporter in 1998. """"I have almost no inhibitions, so it's dangerous for me.""""    2001: 30-Day Rehab Program  In July 2001, after a reported night of hard partying while between his high-profile relationships with Gwyneth Paltrow and Jennifer Lopez, Affleck completed a 30-day residential rehabilitation program for alcohol abuse, driven to Promises in Malibu by his friend, Charlie Sheen,People reported at the time. After news broke to the press, his publicist confirmed Affleck's rehab stay. """"Ben is a self-aware and smart man who has decided that a fuller life awaits him without alcohol,"""" the rep stated. """"He is committed to traveling to a healthier road with the support of his family friends and fans.""""  """"I went to rehab for being 29 and partying too much and not having a lot of boundaries and to clear my head and try to get some idea of who I wanted to be,"""" Affleck told The Hollywood Reporter in 2012, declining to go into further detail. """"It was more a 'let me get myself straight,' before it became a rite of passage.""""    2004: Jennifer Garner's Positive Influence  In 2004, Affleck married Daredevil co-star Jennifer Garner, who a source tells ET put a stop to Affleck's hard partying ways and helped the actor settle down.  According to the source, friends noticed a significant change in the actor after the two got together, noting that Affleck was different than with past women he had dated. He settled down with Garner's positive influence, which """"lasted for a long time"""" -- until the pair's split in June 2015.  """"I think becoming a father makes you see the world differently and it’s good,"""" Affleck said in a January 2017 interview with The Guardian, reflecting on his past mistakes and his three children with Garner: Violet, 11, Seraphina, 8, and Sam, 5.  """"I’d always had a strong idea about my values and the direction I wanted to be headed in, then I ran into getting famous and it totally spun me around and I flailed around for a few years,"""" he confessed. """"When you’re a young man in your 20s, part of that is making mistakes and learning from them. I just made those in front of everybody, rather than privately.""""  January 2017: Spotted Out With Sober Coach  Affleck handled his most recent stint in rehab much more privately, though clues to the actor's struggles appeared in January, when the father of three was spotted with a blonde woman while out and about in Los Angeles.  Though some at the time speculated that Affleck might have moved on from Garner (despite living on the same compound), a source told ET at the time that the woman was Elizabeth Weaver, a sober coach with whom he was working to make """"sure he stays on the right path.""""  """"Ben has spent a good amount of time with her in recent weeks to kick his alcohol addiction,"""" the source said. """"Ben is taking getting sober very seriously and knows he has to do this for his kids. Ben would do anything for his children and is hoping this will make his relationship with Jen better.""""  February 2017: Staying Sober at the Oscars  A source tells ET that though Affleck is no longer working with Weaver, he was sober at the 2017 Academy Awards while supporting his little brother, Casey, as he won the Best Actor Oscar, and had a male sober companion by his side throughout the night.  March 2017: """"Feeling Good"""" After Rehab Announcement  Affleck's Tuesday announcement credited his family, namely his three children, as his motivation for seeking treatment.  """"I have completed treatment for alcohol addiction; something I've dealt with in the past and will continue to confront. I want to live life to the fullest and be the best father I can be,"""" he wrote on Facebook. """"I want my kids to know there is no shame in getting help when you need it, and to be a source of strength for anyone out there who needs help but is afraid to take the first step.""""  """"I'm lucky to have the love of my family and friends, including my co-parent, Jen, who has supported me and cared for our kids as I've done the work I set out to do,"""" he continued. """"This was the first of many steps being taken towards a positive recovery.""""  """"Ben did this for himself and his family. Family always comes first,"""" a source tells ET. """"Ben has struggled with alcohol for years and it's a struggle that millions of people have to battle everyday. He has nothing to hide and wants his kids to know that he did everything he could to be a better father. That's why he announced it himself.""""  """"He has completed his treatment and is feeling good,"""" the source adds.    2018: Returns to Rehab  Affleck was taken to LA area facility on Wednesday, August 22 by his ex Jennifer Garner.    """"Garner was very emotional but decided to take the situation into her own hands,"""" an eyewitness tells ET. Garner appeared visibly shaken. """"She looked distraught.""""  On Wednesday, a separate source told ET that the actor has """"worked very hard to stay clean"""" since his last stint in treatment, but there are concerns that he could be backsliding.  """"Jen [Garner] is proud of the strides he's made, but some of his friends were worried he might be taking some steps backward and could be on a slippery slope,"""" the source said.""""Ben wants nothing more than to get sober for his kids, for Jen and also for his career.""""  The source added that Affleck """"realizes the dangers of what he could lose in life if he doesn't stick to the program, and dedicate himself to these big changes.""""

However, it turns out that the Real Housewives of Atlanta star‘s latest get-rich-quick plan isn’t panning out so far.  According to Life & Style, NeNe is trying to get paid to endorse a major weight-loss product but isn’t getting any bites from companies.  “NeNe’s put on a few extra pounds,” says a source, “so she’s been reaching out to companies in hopes of getting a deal like Oprah Winfrey has with Weight Watchers, or Marie Osmond has with Nutrisystem.”  But it seems that companies aren’t interested.  Why do you ask?  NeNe “is a hothead,” sources say. “No big company wants to gamble that she can keep her attitude at bay.”  Adding that, “she sticks her foot in her mouth way too much.”  A perfect example of NeNe’s hotheaded ways is the not so funny rape joke she made during a stand-up show a few months back.  I think NeNe would be a good spokesperson on a good day, but then again she has a nasty side she can’t always keep in check. Good PR is everything, and NeNe’s antics don’t always make that easy.

The 48-year-old said he 'began asking John when was the last time he saw Aniston, how awkward this was, and if there were ways I could make it more awkward'.  Andy added: 'We realized they had to walk by our table to leave and that would be a """"moment."""" We wondered if it was more fun at our table or theirs.'  Snubbed: The Friends star (shown in September) apparently ignored the singer (pictured last month) when they were seated near each other at the Sunset Tower hotel  The Watch What Happens Live host suggested that John join him in going over to say hello, but that John made it very clear this would be a bad idea.  'He told me with a look that the Queen of Smartwater would not be having it,' he wrote.  According to Radar, Andy and John left first and the bitter exes didn't have to come face to face.  Juicy: Andy, who is close friends with John, recalled the encounter in his new book Superficial  John and Jennifer dated on and off for a year from 2008 to 2009.

'We just have a regard for each other’s feelings that is pretty intense,' he said. 'It’s been a deep relationship, and it’s no longer taking place at all. Have you ever loved somebody, loved her completely, but had to end the relationship for life reasons?'  Not so amicable exes: John has discussed ending his relationship with Jen 'for life reasons' in the years following their split in 2009. They are pictured in 2008  He later told Rolling Stone: 'I've never really gotten over it. It was one of the worst times of my life.'

"""Angelina Jolie Returning to Acting After Taking Time Off for 'Family Situation': 'I've Been Needed at Home' Angelina Jolie is making her return to the big screen.  The 42-year-old director and actress has steadily become known for her work behind the camera -- her new film, First They Killed My Father, was recently well-received at the Telluride Film Festival -- but in a new interview, Jolie says she's set to make a return to acting. She also acknowledges that her split from Brad Pitt has affected her work schedule, explaining that she had to take time off due to their changing family dynamic.  """"Right now I don't have anything to direct that I feel passionate about like this [First They Killed My Father], so I'll do some acting,"""" she tells The Hollywood Reporter.""""I've taken over a year off now, because of my family situation, to take care of my kids.""""

Jolie says her next project will most likely be a sequel to 2014's Maleficent, and that she's also seen a script for the much talked-about Cleopatra, though she hasn't committed to anything. She also makes it clear that although she is planning to return to acting, if it was up to her, she would solely direct.  """"I would love to at some point,"""" she says about making the switch. """"At some point, I'll probably just direct. If I'm allowed to. But you just don't know if you can have a career as a director. You don't know how things are going to be received.""""  Jolie's latest film, First They Called My Father -- about Cambodian refugee Loung Ung, who lived through the deadly Khmer Rouge in the late 1970s -- is clearly personal given that she adopted her oldest child, Maddox, from Cambodia when he was three months old. Maddox, now 16, is a producer on the film.  """"Cambodia made me a mother,"""" she says about why she chose to have a joint U.S.-Cambodian citizenship. """"Maddox -- that's the beginning of my family: Mad and I coming together was the beginning of so much. So I feel so connected to this country, and I was really honored and wanted to do great things for the country, and work in an even deeper way.""""

""""Funnily enough, Shiloh speaks the most [Khmer], my middle girl, born in Namibia,"""" she shares. """"My kids are from different countries, but there's an understanding, you don't have to like a country just because you were born in it. You need to respect all countries.

"""Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show controversy 2004 controversy over indecent exposure on television  Super Bowl XXXVIII – which was broadcast live on February 1, 2004 from Houston, Texas on the CBS television network in the United States – was noted for a controversial halftime show in which Janet Jackson's breast, adorned with a nipple shield, was exposed by Justin Timberlake for about half a second, in what was later referred to as a """"wardrobe malfunction"""".[1] The incident, sometimes referred to as Nipplegate,[2][3] was widely discussed. Along with the rest of the halftime show, it led to an immediate crackdown and widespread debate on perceived indecency in broadcasting.[1] The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) fined CBS a record US$550,000 which was fought in the Supreme Court,[4] but that fine was appealed and ultimately voided by the Third Circuit Court of Appeals in a 2011 ruling, and a case to reinstate the fine was refused in 2012.[5][6]  The incident was ridiculed both within the United States and abroad, with a number of commentators considering the incident a planned publicity stunt,[7] and American commentators in particular viewing it as a sign of decreasing morality in American culture, while others considered the incident harmless and argued that it received an undue amount of attention and backlash.[8][9][10][11][12] The increased regulation of broadcasting raised concerns regarding censorship and free speech in the United States,[13] and the FCC increased the fine per indecency violation from US$27,500 to US$325,000 shortly after the event.[14] The halftime show that year was produced by MTV and was themed around the network's Choose or Lose campaign due to the event occurring during a presidential election year. Following the wardrobe incident, the National Football League (NFL) announced that MTV, which also produced the halftime show for Super Bowl XXXV, would not be involved in any halftime shows in the future.[15] The MTV Chief Executive stated in an interview with Reuters that Jackson engineered the stunt, while Timberlake was informed of it just moments before he took the stage.[16][17] The exposure was broadcast to a total audience of 143.6 million viewers.[18]  YouTube co-founder Jawed Karim claims that this incident was what led to the creation of the video sharing website.[19][20] The incident also made """"Janet Jackson"""" the most searched term, event, and image in Internet history, as well as the most searched person and term of 2004 and 2005.[21][22][23][24] The incident also broke the record for """"most searched event over one day"""".[25] Jackson was later listed in the 2007 edition of Guinness World Records as """"Most Searched in Internet History"""" and the """"Most Searched for News Item"""".[26] It became the most watched, recorded and replayed television moment in TiVo history and """"enticed an estimated 35,000 new [TiVo] subscribers to sign up"""".[27][28][29] The incident also coined the phrase """"wardrobe malfunction"""", which was later added to the Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary.[30]  Following the incident, CBS parent company Viacom, and their co-owned subsidiaries MTV and Infinity Broadcasting, enforced a blacklist of Jackson's singles and music videos on many radio formats and music channels worldwide.[31] As of 2018, neither Jackson nor Timberlake are banned from the halftime show.[32] Timberlake later performed at Super Bowl LII on February 4, 2018.  Background and development [ edit ]  In 2002, Entertainment Weekly reported that Jackson was the original choice to perform at the halftime show for Super Bowl XXXVI, however the NFL ultimately decided to select U2 to headline it after a group of NFL owners and officials attended the band's concert in New York City shortly after the September 11 attacks.[33] In September 2003, the NFL announced that Jackson would be the headline performer of the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show.[34] Because the event was occurring during an election year, MTV decided that the show's theme would heavily focus on the network's """"Choose or Lose"""" campaign, which encouraged younger viewers to be politically active and register to vote.[35]  Prior to the incident, Timberlake had attended Jackson's Rhythm Nation Tour as an adolescent, and Jackson's energetic dance routines and daring performing style made a deep impression on him.[36] While Timberlake was a member of pop group 'N Sync, Jackson selected the boy band as the opening act for many dates of her blockbuster Velvet Rope World Tour, which helped promote and introduce the then-relatively unknown group and Timberlake to the public worldwide.[37] Timberlake said he was """"psyched"""" and later described the experience as """"fulfilling"""".[38][39] While on the tour, Jackson further promoted the group by performing with 'N Sync on several dates, including joining the group for a live a cappella duet of Stevie Wonder's """"Overjoyed"""", which a biography stated was a """"highlight"""" moment for Timberlake which """"gave Justin a chance to show his family and friends how far he had come"""".[40] Following the tour, Timberlake and Jackson became """"good friends"""", with Jackson also praising Timberlake.[41] Timberlake recreated Jackson's """"That's the Way Love Goes"""" video with 'N Sync and was inspired by Jackson's performing style.[42]  Timberlake had frequently mentioned admiring Jackson in many interviews during this time and throughout the following few years preceding the incident.[38][39][43] When asked who he thought was """"the sexiest woman on the planet"""", Timberlake had said """"I've thought Janet Jackson has nothing but sex appeal, so I'd probably say her.""""[44]  Timberlake later asked Jackson to sing backing vocals on """"(And She Said) Take Me Now"""", a song from his debut solo album Justified which was initially planned to be released as a single, commenting """"I wrote the chorus from a girl's perspective, and I just thought we should get a female on the part. Her name was the first that popped up in my head just because I love her voice. It sounds like feathers. I mean, she sounds like an angel.""""[45]  Incident [ edit ]  During the halftime show, Jackson performed a medley of hits, beginning with """"All for You"""", """"Rhythm Nation"""" and a brief excerpt of """"The Knowledge"""" before surprise guest Timberlake appeared to perform a duet of his song """"Rock Your Body"""" with Jackson.[46][47] The performance featured several suggestive dance moves by both singers, and as Timberlake reached his final line of """"Rock Your Body"""", """"I'm gonna have you naked by the end of this song"""", Timberlake pulled off a part of Jackson's costume, revealing her right breast, partially covered by a piece of nipple jewelry, for less than a second (after which the CBS broadcast immediately cut to an aerial view of Reliant Stadium). MTV's CEO Tom Freston claimed in an interview with the Reuters news agency that the exposure was a stunt orchestrated by Jackson.[48] Jackson's publicist stated the performance ending was only supposed to reveal Jackson's red lace bra, though the lace undergarment was accidentally removed along with the outer layer.[8][49]  Responses [ edit ]  """"It's truly embarrassing for me to know that 90 million [140 million] people saw my breast, and then to see it blown up on the Internet the size of a computer screen ..."""" """"But there are much worse things in the world, and for this to be such a focus, I don't understand"""". – Jackson on Super Bowl incident.[50]  MTV stated, """"The tearing of Janet Jackson's costume was unrehearsed, unplanned, completely unintentional and was inconsistent with assurances we had about the content of the performance. MTV regrets this incident occurred and we apologize to anyone who was offended by it.""""[51] The network also said, """"Our goal with the Super Bowl Halftime show was to produce an entertaining stage experience with a positive message about empowerment and voting. We are disappointed that this message has been overshadowed by the unfortunate incident"""".[52] A statement from CBS read, """"We attended all rehearsals throughout the week and there was no indication that any such thing would happen. The moment did not conform to CBS broadcast standards and we would like to apologize to anyone who was offended.""""[51] Viacom President Mel Karmazin said that while the company can be proud of 99% of what people saw on the broadcast, it understands """"what a difference one percent can make"""". NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue said the show produced by MTV, which like CBS, was owned by Viacom at the time (before the two networks were respectively separated into Viacom and CBS Corporation, both controlled by National Amusements, in December 2005), fell far short of the """"tasteful, first-class entertainment"""" the league expected. FCC Chairman Michael Powell, appearing before a Senate panel, called the Super Bowl incident """"a new low for prime time television"""".[53][54] Joe Browne, Executive Vice President of the NFL, said, """"We were extremely disappointed by elements of the MTV-produced Halftime show. They were totally inconsistent with assurances our office was given about the show. It's unlikely that MTV will produce another Super Bowl halftime.""""[51] An hour-long MTV documentary titled """"Making the Super Bowl Halftime Show"""" was scheduled to premiere the following week but was canceled before it ever aired and has never been broadcast subsequently.[55][56]  Salli Frattini, the executive producer for MTV who had planned the entire performance, recalled a phone call from the officiating booth that was her first indication something had gone wrong. Frattini was in a truck outside of Reliant Stadium celebrating the end of the 12-minute halftime performance, which they initially thought was a success. """"We were like, 'Uh, we’re playing that back right now'"""", Frattini said. """"There was lots of chaos in the truck, and we played it back and we were like, 'Oh, s[hit]. What just happened?'"""" Alex Coletti, another MTV producer, said he could not find Jackson after the performance. """"I tried to get in touch to make sure she was okay"""", he said. """"Her entire camp stopped answering the phones. I finally got to her tour manager, and they were already at the airport."""" Coletti assumed the singer was so mortified that she fled immediately, though later assumed the incident was a possible """"set up"""", adding it was the last time he had spoken to her. Coletti's assumption is potentially another reason for Jackson's blacklisting on MTV in addition to other music channels and radio formats.[57] An MTV representative confirmed the costume tear was conceptualized by the MTV staff, in which the show's producers mockingly ripped their clothing in response to Timberlake's closing lyric during rehearsals. This led to Jackson and Timberlake improvising the move, in which Timberlake tore off Jackson's kilt. Frattini stated, """"When we did the original rehearsal, there was conversation about a fake skirt she would wear, and that Justin would actually pull open the skirt and take off the skirt. In rehearsal, they actually tried to rip open the skirt, which kind of went with the lyrics of the song"""".[8] The production team then discussed another option, which led to the costume tearing, although the outfit was intended to stay in place.[8]  Jackson's representative explained the incident, saying, """"Justin was supposed to pull away the rubber bustier to reveal a red lace bra. The garment collapsed and her breast was accidentally revealed.""""[58] CBS forced Jackson to release a video apology, and said """"My decision to change the Super Bowl performance was made after the final rehearsal. MTV, CBS, [and] the NFL had no knowledge of this whatsoever and unfortunately, the whole thing went wrong in the end. I am really sorry if I offended anyone, that was truly not my intention"""". A written statement read, """"The decision to have a costume reveal at the end of my halftime show performance was made after final rehearsals. MTV was completely unaware of it. It was not my intention that it go as far as it did. I apologize to anyone offended – including the audience, MTV, CBS and the NFL.""""[52] Due to the event being accidental and unintentional, Jackson refused to release another apology statement to media outlets following this. Speaking to USA Today, Jackson said, """"It's truly embarrassing for me to know that 90 million [140 million] people saw my breast, and then to see it blown up on the Internet the size of a computer screen ... but there are much worse things in the world, and for this to be such a focus, I don't understand.""""[50] Regarding continued backlash, she responded, """"Who knows...Maybe they'll get mad at something that I do in my show, but at least it won't be new to me, since I've already gone through all of this. But I feel very positive that things are going to work out just fine. Everything happens for a reason.""""[50]  Publicist Marvet Britto stated, """"Jackson embodies grace, style and integrity...She has never been known as a bad person."""" Britto describes Jackson’s videotaped apology as """"impersonal"""", saying, """"She has never been an impersonal artist, so it made it seem like she was guilty of something, and she wasn't. I would have had her and Timberlake apologizing side by side right from the beginning, since they performed side by side. Otherwise, it made the whole apology seem calculated and contrived."""" Jackson said of the apology, """"I probably should have done it live. But there was so much going on at the time that I needed to just get it done. It is what it is. And it will pass, and I'm fine with it.""""[59] At one point Jackson was scheduled to be interviewed about the incident by Diane Sawyer on the ABC newsmagazine Primetime, however, the interview never came to fruition.[60] Jackson later briefly discussed the incident on Good Morning America and the Late Show with David Letterman. Jackson's outfit was designed by famed designer Alexander McQueen, with Jackson later commenting """"I don't blame him; he didn't rip it. Alexander is so great at what he does – he's a genius.""""[61] In an interview with Australia's Herald Sun, Jackson commented on Timberlake (whom, as mentioned, Jackson had previously known personally and aided when she selected his former group 'N Sync to open for her Velvet Rope World Tour at the start of their career[36][38]) distancing himself from the incident and seemingly changing with fame. """"I really want to be honest about this, but I just feel that anything I say about him will be taken the wrong way"""", said Jackson. """"I do think that Justin is very talented and that he has a very big career ahead of him. But he seems to have changed recently. He's gotten a bit cocky. You know, some people can handle success and some people can't. I'm starting to wonder if (the latter) is the case with Justin. And it hurts me to say that.""""[62] Producer Jimmy Jam revealed Jackson considered writing a song about the incident for her Damita Jo album, saying, """"I don't know whether it will or not. But I have a feeling it probably will, because kind of whatever's happening in her life tends to be what she writes about [...] It'd be kind of interesting to see what her feeling is about it.""""[63]  famine, homelessness, """"[The furor] is hypocritical, with everything you see on TV. There are more important thing to focus on than a woman's body part, which is a beautiful thing. There's war AIDS . [...] They needed something to focus on instead of the war, and I was the perfect vehicle for that. [...] People are going to think what they want. It was an accident. It was not a stunt. That was embarrassing for me to have all those people see my breast."""" – Jackson questioning media's focus on the event.[50]  Michael Musto of The Village Voice commented on the media's reaction to the incident, saying, """"Janet became a symbolic Joan of Arc to burn at the stake. I actually do think her breast was used as a diversionary tactic – I'm not sure to distract from Iraq specifically – but it did distract from important issues, from things we actually should be appalled by. The story got an undue amount of attention when the fact is, nobody has proved how her breast harmed anyone.""""[64] Speaking to Robert Tannenbaum of Blender Magazine, Jackson had strong, if guarded, views on the reactions, saying the furor """"is hypocritical, with everything you see on TV. There are more important thing to focus on than a woman's body part, which is a beautiful thing. There's war, famine, homelessness, AIDS"""". The fact that it happened in an election year """"did have a great deal to do with it. They needed something to focus on instead of the war, and I was the perfect vehicle for that. People are going to think what they want. It was an accident. It was not a stunt. That was embarrassing for me to have all those people see my breast. That's like having your penis hanging out in front of millions and millions of people.""""[31]Janet declared the reaction to the accidental exposure as """"contradictory"""", noting it to occur in an era where commercials for beer and Viagra are both """"very sexual"""" and """"practically omnipresent"""".[64] Jackson also said the mishap was """"not intentional"""" and a """"costume accident"""", also commenting on some media outlets editing her taped apology, saying, """"Sometimes they cut out that I said it was an accident...That's what the media does, that's the way they are because they want it to be told a different way.""""[65] In Glamour Magazine, Janet exclaimed, """"It's hard to believe that there's a war and famine going on in the world and yet people made such a big deal about a breast. People said that it was done intentionally to sell records. Do you know what? I have never pulled a stunt. Why would you do that and have your album come out two months later? It doesn't make sense."""" In the ensuing months, Janet felt overwhelmed by the hostility towards her. """"People think I'm immune to being hurt by what's said. They ask me questions that shock me. Not everybody is as strong as the next person and words can kill. People push you and you start to think, 'Can I handle this?' But I know I can.""""[66]  Immediately following the incident, Timberlake sounded unapologetic for his actions, telling Access Hollywood, """"Hey man, we love giving you all something to talk about.""""[49] Timberlake released a statement saying """"I am sorry that anyone was offended by the wardrobe malfunction during the halftime performance of the Super Bowl. It was not intentional and is regrettable.""""[51] However, Timberlake was not required to film a video apology as Jackson was. Timberlake also addressed the incident at the Grammy Awards the following week, which Jackson was banned from attending after being scheduled as a presenter, saying """"I know it's been a rough week on everybody. What occurred was unintentional, completely regrettable and I apologize if you guys are offended.""""[67] Timberlake gave an additional interview at the Grammy event and stated, """"All I could say was, 'Oh, my God. Oh, my God,'"""" Timberlake said. """"I looked at her. They brought a towel up on stage. They covered her up. I was completely embarrassed and just walked off the stage as quickly as I could. I'm frustrated at the whole situation. I'm frustrated that my character is being questioned. And the fact of the matter is, you know, I've had a good year, a really good year, especially with my music.""""[68] Timberlake later declared, """"It was something that went wrong. Then I felt like, I'm going to show everyone that this was something that didn't affect me, and I'm going to show up at the Grammys.""""[69] He later said he was unable to attend most of the halftime rehearsals due to being on tour in Spain, having only one day to rehearse.[70] While promoting his sophomore album FutureSex/LoveSounds over two years later, Timberlake expressed regret for his behavior, saying, """"In my honest opinion now ... I could've handled it better. ... I'm part of a community that consider themselves artists. And if there was something I could have done in her defense that was more than I realized then, I would have. But the other half of me was like, 'Wow. We still haven't found the weapons of mass destruction and everybody cares about this!'"""" He added, """"I probably got 10 percent of the blame, and that says something about society ... I think that America's harsher on women. And I think that America is, you know, unfairly harsh on ethnic people.""""[71]  Media diversion [ edit ]  Jackson suspected ulterior motives in the media's reaction, expressing, """"It was just perfect timing to take people's focus off of other things. That's what happens, and it happened to me.""""[50] Accounts from several university leaders and management groups offered a similar premise. Michael Rich, director of Harvard's Center on Media and Child Health, exclaimed, """"Here we have Michael Powell upset about the happening in the Super Bowl, but the same Powell has been unwilling to do anything about the violence on television, where there has been much more research showing it has a harmful impact on kids."""" Robert Thompson, founding director of the Center for the Study of Popular Television at Syracuse University, said, """"Michael Powell is representing the Super Bowl like everybody in the family sits around knitting booties, or like, it's the Macy's Day Parade. [...] Come on. There's gambling, there's a lot of drinking, partying, a carnival atmosphere"""", he asserted. Jay Rosenthal, attorney for the Recording Artists' Coalition, says the FCC's involvement was a smoke-screen, or a """"sound bite attempt"""" by the Republican-led commission to act as if it's doing something. """"When it comes to media consolidation issues affecting consumers and artists, they don't care about that. But when it comes to indecency, after ignoring it for years, all of a sudden they're snapping to attention"""", he said. Simon Renshaw of management group The Firm stated it to be """"inappropriate"""" that Powell is trying to distract people from the real issues of what's currently going on in the media. """"What I find offensive is CBS' refusal to carry MoveOn.org's ad during the Super Bowl"""", which pictured children working in factories to pay off the Bush administration's budget deficit.[72] The Boston Legal episode """"Let Sales Ring"""" likened the incident to being used as a distraction, portraying a news corporation which used the mishap to attract attention over other important events in the media.[73] Daniel Kreps of Rolling Stone explained, """"For the FCC, Nipplegate provided an opportunity to restore order and flex whatever power they had left. Faced with lax broadcast standards for cable TV and satellite radio, as well as the absolute lawlessness of the Internet, the FCC becomes hell-bent on preserving common decency in the family-friendly realm of network television. Thus, screws are tightened everywhere under the body's jurisdiction: Tape delays are lengthened and more frequent and sexually suggestive performances are replaced by less provocative selections. While the aftermath of Nipplegate starts to fade, the FCC will continue to carry its torch for the next half-decade.""""[74] Cynthia Fuchs of Popmatters stated, """"It behooves TV producers and consumers to focus their attentions on significant """"news"""", rather than the daily distractions offered up by politicians, performers, professional spinners, and journalists. Janet is not that person you watch on TV. And neither is anyone else.""""[75]  Powell's response [ edit ]  A decade after the incident, former FCC chairman Michael Powell gave his first interview regarding Jackson's performance, saying Jackson was treated unfairly and the controversy, including his own reaction, was completely overblown. Powell stated, """"I think we've been removed from this long enough for me to tell you that I had to put my best version of outrage on that I could put on. Part of it was surreal, right? Look, I think it was dumb to happen, and they knew the rules and were flirting with them, and my job is to enforce the rules, but, you know, really? This is what we're gonna do?"""" Powell also said the treatment of Jackson, who was lambasted for causing """"an outrageous stunt"""", was unfair, and commented on Timberlake not receiving the same backlash. """"I personally thought that was really unfair"""", he said. """"It all turned into being about her. In reality, if you slow the thing down, it’s Justin ripping off her breastplate.""""[57]  Public reaction [ edit ]  United States [ edit ]  In the United States, the exposure of Jackson's breast by Timberlake led to much media attention and headlines, in which it was sometimes referred to as """"Nipplegate"""".[2][3] The socially conservative media watchdog group Parents Television Council (PTC) issued a statement that same day condemning the halftime show, announcing that their members would file indecency complaints with the FCC and the council supported the Commission's decision to investigate the halftime show immediately.[76] In addition, the FCC received nearly 540,000 complaints from Americans,[15] with the PTC claiming responsibility for around 65,000 of them.[77] In its appeal to the Third Circuit Court, CBS disputed how many of the complaints were filed by individual, non-organized viewers.[78] Columnists L. Brent Bozell III[9] (who also founded the Parents Television Council) and Phyllis Schlafly[12] also expressed criticism of the halftime show in their weekly columns. Democratic senator Zell Miller of Georgia, both on the floor of the United States Senate[11] and in an editorial on Salon.com,[10] denounced the halftime show as what he perceived as declining morality in America. The day immediately following the Super Bowl, then-FCC chairman Michael Powell ordered an investigation into the halftime show..[1] Timberlake told CBS owned-and-operated station KCBS-TV in Los Angeles a few days following the Super Bowl that even his own family was offended by the mishap at the end of the halftime show.[79] However, an Associated Press poll taken nearly three weeks after the Super Bowl found that although 54% of American adults considered the exposure distasteful, only 18% supported the FCC's investigation.[80] Film director Spike Lee, speaking at Kent State University at Stark on February 3, called the incident a """"new low"""" in entertainment.[2]  The Super Bowl controversy was also a subject of humor on all of the late-night talk shows. For example, CBS's own Late Show with David Letterman mocked the incident all week following the Super Bowl. Host David Letterman jokingly commented on the controversy the day after the Super Bowl that he """"was happy to see this thing happen ... because that meant for one night I wasn't the biggest boob on CBS"""".[81] The next day, he also joked that President George W. Bush formed a """"Department of Wardrobe Security"""" to prevent further wardrobe malfunctions.[82] On February 4, Letterman opened his monologue by joking about having a wardrobe malfunction.[83] Additionally, the Top Ten Lists featured on the program on that same night[84] briefly referenced the incident. Jackson's appearance on the Late Show the following month increased the show's ratings 20% from the program's usual weeknight opener.[85] Larry King also stated Jackson jokingly gave him a pair of suspenders with open holes around the nipples, commenting """"I wore them once, they were cute.""""[86] Democratic presidential candidate Howard Dean called the FCC's investigation """"silly"""", commenting """"In general, I think the FCC does have a role in promoting some reasonable standard of decency. However, considering what's on television these days, I think the FCC is being pretty silly about investigating this."""" Dean added """"I don't find it terribly shocking relative to some of the things you can find on standard cable television. I think the FCC probably has a lot of other things they should be pursuing.""""[87]  South Park (aired on Comedy Central, a sister network to CBS at the time, and to MTV through Viacom) took aim at the hysteria in its eighth season premiere, """"Good Times with Weapons"""", on March 17 of that year when Eric Cartman sneaks across a stage in the nude and later blames the incident on a """"wardrobe malfunction"""". The townspeople are angered by Cartman's display, rather than feeling concern for a badly injured and disoriented character (Butters) who is also present on stage – a reference to the American culture's acceptance of violence while maintaining a taboo against nudity.[88] During the 2004 MTV Video Music Awards, comedian Dave Chappelle joked that his appearance on the VMAs was """"the biggest mistake [MTV made] since [they] put Janet Jackson on the Super Bowl.""""[89] Family Guy also did an episode based around the """"wardrobe malfunction"""" and the FCC's crackdown on """"indecent"""" content, with one scene parodying the incident directly.[90] The fourth season episode """"PTV"""" involved actor David Hyde Pierce having a trouser malfunction at the Emmys. The FCC's sudden crackdown on indecent material on television leads an angered Peter Griffin to start his own network with looser content standards, PTV, on which later in the same episode, he presents a show called the """"Side Boob Hour"""" which among other risque programs he puts on leads his objected wife Lois to call the FCC to crack down on PTV (leading to the implication of the FCC also regulating what his family says and does).  The halftime show continued to be a subject of discussion in 2005. At the beginning of 2005, the parody newspaper The Onion ran as its headline article for January 26, 2005, """"U.S. Children Still Traumatized One Year After Seeing Partially Exposed Breast On TV"""". The article's satirical target was the nation's reaction to the incident, rather than the incident itself.[91] On February 1, 2005, exactly one year after the halftime show, the PTC released a report titled MTV Smut Peddlers: Targeting Kids with Sex, Drugs, and Alcohol, covering MTV programming during the network's """"Spring Break"""" week from March 20 to 27, 2004, accusing MTV of irresponsibly promoting sex, drugs and alcohol to impressionable youth. In response to the report, MTV network executive Jeannie Kedas argued that the report """"underestimates young people's intellect and their level of sophistication.""""[92] On February 6, however, New York Times columnist Frank Rich argued that censorship on television was becoming more prevalent following the halftime show in his February 6, 2005 column """"The Year of Living Indecently"""". Examples he cited included PBS editing obscene language out of certain programs such as the British terrorist drama Dirty War and more than 60 ABC-affiliated stations (including those owned by the Sinclair Broadcast Group, E. W. Scripps Company, Hearst-Argyle Television and Cox Broadcasting) refusing to broadcast Saving Private Ryan due to the profanity prevalent throughout the film, which was to be aired unedited in its entirety by the network. (The latter, which would later be ruled the FCC to not violate regulations, would air on cable afterwards to avoid controversy.)[93] The ESPN series Playmakers was also immediately forced to be canceled by the NFL following the incident.[94][95] A commercial from Budweiser, which depicted a man opening a beverage on the outfit's breastplate and tearing it before it was worn, was intended to be aired during Super Bowl XXXIX the following year, but was pulled before its broadcast.[96][97]  Canada [ edit ]  In Canada, where the Super Bowl telecast was broadcast by the Global Television Network, the incident passed largely without controversy: only about 50 Canadians complained about the incident to the Canadian Broadcast Standards Council (CBSC).[98] The CBSC received roughly twice as many complaints about other aspects of the Super Bowl broadcast, including music and advertising issues (though some were expected complaints about Canadian content/simsub issues preventing viewing of the popular American advertisements, which is a common issue among Canadian viewers of the Super Bowl to the present day).[99] Professor Robert Thompson, director of the Center for the Study of Popular Television at Syracuse University, stated: """"I know many people in other countries are scratching their heads and thinking 'What in the world is the big fuss over there?'""""[100]  New Zealand [ edit ]  New Zealand news outlets re-broadcast the """"nipplegate"""" moment (some in slow motion) with commentary explaining that American ultra-conservatives had made the incident into a major controversy.

"""Emma Watson and Robert Pattinson Had a Mini ‘Harry Potter’ Reunion at the 2018 Golden Globes The 2018 Golden Globes had no shortage of A-list presenters at Sunday’s show, but one pairing in particular caused quite a bit of commotion on social media. Emma Watson and Robert Pattinson had a surprise Harry Potter reunion as they appeared together to present an award, and fans could not handle the excitement.  The actors, who played Hermione Granger and Cedric Diggory in the franchise, were on hand to present the Best Limited Series or TV Movie award. Standing side by side — both in all black in support of the Time’s Up movement — they transported fans back to 2005, when they starred opposite each other in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire.  GoF was the only film in the franchise that featured Pattinson’s Cedric (RIP), while Watson of course went on to appear in all eight movies based on the JK Rowling book series.  It’s been over a decade since the stars appeared on the big screen together, and fans could not handle the sight of them together again, taking to social media to scream in excitement.

"""Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie: Could they go to trial over the kids? CLOSE They made us fall head over heels, then they broke our hearts. A previous version of this video misidentified Jenna Dewan. USA TODAY  It's been two years since Angelina Jolie filed for divorce from Brad Pitt. What happens now? (Photo: AP)  Wrap it up.  That’s what image experts would say to Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt, the once-golden couple now edging into explosive Hollywood divorce territory occupied by the likes of Woody Allen and Mia Farrow.  Today, """"most celebrities keep their divorces private, they settle them quickly usually with a press release,” says Christopher Melcher, partner of the California firm Walzer Melcher family law. “We rarely see this kind of nastiness that's happened recently.”  Brangelina is now shorthand for textbook anti-conscious uncoupling. Still, resolution – especially when six children are involved – is a thorny endeavor. So could this all end with a messy public spectacle?  After a summer of freshly boiled acrimony, the fractured family is back in Los Angeles, and the couple has seemingly recommitted to a previously agreed-upon temporary custody agreement. A scheduled hearing in family court on Aug. 21 was postponed. Pitt is seeing the children regularly.  Jolie “continues to support the reconciliation of the children with Brad and everything she does is focused on healing her family,” a source close to Jolie, who was not authorized to speak publicly, tells USA TODAY.  But what a road to get to this point.  A messy summer  In June, their divorce made headlines again when the couple's private judge threatened Jolie, saying if the actress doesn't start encouraging her children to forge relationships with her ex, she could be in danger of losing custody.  The judge further ordered Jolie to arrange a phone call with the kids and their doctors to explain to the children that “the court has determined that each of them are safe with their father.”  “What I imagine is difficult for Angelina is, how can somebody else override a parent’s decision? How can a judge tell her as a mom what’s best for her children? That’s the consequence on not agreeing with the other parent and submitting it to a judge,” says Melcher.  The lawyer adds: """"Maybe she knows something nobody else does, but the judge did not agree with her. And ultimately, the judge makes these decisions.""""  More: The highest-paid actresses in the world: Johansson, Jolie, Aniston  And so it got uglier. With both stars asserting they wanted to move forward in dissolving their marriage (a process known as bifurcation), Jolie’s new lawyer, Samantha Bley DeJean, accused Pitt of not having paid “meaningful"""" child support in court documents.  As the news went viral, Pitt’s lawyers quickly countered, detailing an $8 million housing loan plus $1.3 million in child care paid since their split. Pitt's lawyer, Lance Spiegel, called the legal maneuvering """"a thinly veiled effort to manipulate media coverage.""""  But Jolie's lawyer doubled down, indicating that not only was Pitt charging the mother of his children interest on her new home, but he was also not paying half their expenses.  Image-wise, all of this matters: In the past two years, Jolie’s negative Q score, the industry's most commonly used measure of likability, has gone up four points. Pitt's negative score has remained static.  “Whatever’s been happening in the media, he’s been dealing with it better, based on the data,” says Henry Schafer, executive vice president of Q Score. """"It looks like based on consumer reaction that he’s weathering the storm much better than she is.”  The downfall of Brangelina  The uber-private, A-list couple married in 2014 after a decade of globe-trotting and children together, but the facade shattered in September 2016, when Jolie filed for divorce citing the """"health of her family"""" after a private plane ride in which Pitt was alleged to have had a physical altercation with their eldest child, Maddox, who is now 17.  In the months that followed, each staffed up with power lawyers and various advisers. Allegations flew in the media and legal documents were leaked from family court. Pitt, who was cleared of child abuse allegations, confessed a serious drinking problem to GQ, saying he was now sober.  The two appeared to reach a detente in January 2017, releasing a joint statement stating they had agreed to handle their divorce privately and would work together to reunify their family. (California law favors joint custody in divorce cases.)  More: Lawyer seeks to sue Brad Pitt's Make It Right foundation over houses in New Orleans  Then this June came, with their judge dressing down Jolie for withholding access to their children. (The court is allowing Maddox to decide how much time he wants to spend with his father. Their other five children are Pax, 14; Zahara, 13; Shiloh, 12; and 10-year old twins Vivienne and Knox.)  """"They’re not healing from divorce. They’re healing from some ... from life, from things in life,"""" Jolie told Vanity Fair in September 2017.  In late August, Jolie officially split from her Los Angeles divorce attorney, Laura Wasser, and hired DeJean, a San Francisco-based attorney whose """"expertise is the protection and best interest of children,” said Jolie's rep, Mindy Nyby, at the time.  Family law attorney Jeffrey Cohen of New York's Cohen Goldstein calls such positioning """"an adversarial stand. This is a sign of the deterioration of the litigation, of the relationships. It looks like it's heading south.""""  And it could it get worse. If Jolie and Pitt can’t bury the hatchet, there’s a chance their custody battle could end up at trial, creating a media storm neither star's image will be able to weather.  Pitt told GQ in May 2017 he knew such an outcome would be a “spectacular” nightmare for everyone involved.  """"I see it happen to friends – I see where the one spouse literally can't tell their own part in it, and is still competing with the other in some way and wants to destroy them and needs vindication by destruction, and just wasting years on that hatred,"""" said Pitt then. """"I don't want to live that way.""""  To that end, compromise could be around the corner. """"Almost every case is settled in the hallway between the parties,"""" says Melcher.  And there are a million reasons to go that way.  “If it goes to an open trial (with) public proceedings, this would be as juicy as they come,” says Cohen. “These are two of the most well-known actors on the planet.”  Read or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2MTpoJe""",/home/yanwang_nuist/dev_workspace/prj_python/fnd-bootstrap/dataset/gossip/Images/gossip_test/kDtv4nrY21cbpgbjMq5q1GKLPMzHyDt1.jpg,0.0

"""Why Meghan Markle Won't Be Able to Have a Baby Shower Meghan Markle has had to give up a lot since marrying Prince Harry — and now she'll have to add baby showers to the list. The new Duchess of Sussex has managed to shake things up since joining the royal family, but she would be breaking royal protocol if she were to throw a bash before any future baby is born. This rule might be a bummer for Meghan, but it actually makes a lot of sense.  """"[The royals] are clearly very wealthy, and a lavish baby shower would be seen as highly inappropriate,"""" ABC News' royal expert Vickie Arbiter said back in 2013 when Kate Middleton was pregnant with Prince George. """"There's nothing they can't go out and buy themselves.""""  Whether or not Meghan could accept baby-related gifts is murky. According to British rules, """"Gifts offered by private individuals living in the United Kingdom not personally known to the Member of the Royal Family should be refused where there are concerns about the propriety or motives of the donor or the gift itself."""" (This is why she and Prince Harry had to return more than $9 milion worth of wedding presents.) Gifts from strangers have to be turned down, but what about offerings from her friends? The answer seems unclear, but it's possible the Duke and Duchess of Sussex would return everything, including gifts from friends, just so they can't be accused of being improper.  Prince Harry and Meghan Markle also have the option of just asking for donations in lieu of gifts, so they don't have to deal with the issue of acceptability. They did this at their wedding, although they received gifts anyway — including their new titles.  Baby showers aren't quite as popular in the United Kingdom as they are here in America, so throwing a baby shower might also be odd in addition to inappropriate. Because Meghan is known for her rule-breaking streak, we guess that she'll at least have her dear friends visit to celebrate. Even a heartfelt congratulations over the phone would suffice.  Of course, we won't have to worry about any of this until Meghan announces that she's expecting (if she ever does!).

There are even reports that they would love for him to propose to their mom so that they can call him their stepdad. That would be awesome to see now wouldn’t it?!  We’ll continue to follow Blake and Gwen’s adorable romance and we hope they continue living their best lives together if it makes them happy!""",/home/yanwang_nuist/dev_workspace/prj_python/fnd-bootstrap/dataset/gossip/Images/gossip_test/wngC4kZleKlY67CF5CQxvUp5wUlgSCs7.jpg,1.0

"""Maks Chmerkovskiy Skipped DWTS Due to a 'Chemistry Issue' With Partner Vanessa Lachey It’s only week 3, but the drama has already begun on Dancing with the Stars.  After Tom Bergeron opened guilty pleasures night by dedicating the show to those affected by the Las Vegas shooting, cohost Erin Andrews informed the audience that pro dancer Maks Chmerkovskiy wouldn’t be taking the stage Monday.  “Maks is dealing with a personal issue so Alan is stepping in and dancing with Vanessa tonight,” she said, referring to pro Alan Bersten, who got eliminated last week with partner Debbie Gibson.  Image zoom Craig Sjodin via Getty  However, sources confirm to PEOPLE that Chmerkovskiy did not perform by choice because of ongoing conflict with Lachey.  “There’s a big chemistry issue,” the insider says. “They both have big personalities and that’s not always the best recipe for a good partnership.”  PEOPLE’s special issue 25 Seasons of ‘Dancing with the Stars’ is on stands now.  Image zoom  While the former Total Request Live host, 36, has called the Ukrainian dancer the “best coach,” the source adds, “They’ve been fighting a lot.” (Reps for Chmerkovskiy and Lachey could not immediately be reached for comment.)  This isn’t the first time Chmerkovskiy, 37, has butted heads with his DWTS celebrity counterparts. In 2015, he told The Real of his season 13 partner, soccer star Hope Solo, “That’s literally the only person that I could dislike from my past, present or future.”  On the other hand, Chmerkovskiy and Olympic skater Meryl Davis, who won season 18, brought out the best in each other.  “I feel that I can really be myself with Maks,” she told PEOPLE in 2014. “He pushes me to stand up for myself, whether it’s in real life or on the dance floor. It’s cool.”  He added at the time, “She lets me be creative. I’ve already done more on this season than I’ve done on Dancing with the Stars in 13 seasons.”  RELATED VIDEO: Peta Murgatroyd and Maksim Chmerkovskiy Welcome Son Shai Aleksander  Andrews, now 39, has also raved about her experience working with the new dad on season 10. ““The reason why Maks and I worked out so well was because I come from a world where all I worked with was men, and pretty much I’m like a guy in a lot of ways,” the ESPN personality told PEOPLE in 2015.  When it comes to Lachey, though, the insider says last week could’ve been her last performance with Chmerkovskiy: “I wouldn’t be surprised if Maks doesn’t return as her partner for the rest of the season.”  However, a DWTS rep says Chmerkovskiy will compete next week.

"""Bachelor Whitney Bischoff Talks Engagement: Didnt Let Past Close Off Heart Millions of people watched her get engaged to Chris Soules on national television last year, but when former Bachelor star Whitney Bischoff and her fiancé Ricky Angel were engaged on July 15, this proposal was decidedly more intimate.  “It was just perfect,” Bischoff tells PEOPLE. “I was completely shocked. Ricky got me good! I was so happy that I couldn’t quit smiling. My cheeks hurt!”  The 31-year-old fertility nurse met sales manager Angel on the dating app Bumble (“Ladies pick — finally it was my choice,” jokes Bischoff) last September; the couple moved in together in May.  “On our first date, we just clicked,” she says. “It was easy and that’s the way it should be.”  Still, Bischoff admits it was “nerve-wracking” to jump back into the dating scene after her painful split from Soules in 2015, nearly seven months after they were engaged. “I was still a little bit broken and trying to pick up the pieces. But from day one there was open communication with Ricky about what I had gone through. I think one of the reasons I fell in love so quickly is that I could say everything and know I was not being judged.”  Bischoff hasn’t spoken to Soules recently but says she wishes him well. “I hope that he meets someone, if he hasn’t already, just as great for him and Ricky is for me.”  Now, Bischoff still watches The Bachelor, but says she’s moved on from her own reality show past. “That journey was a big part of my life,” she says. “But since I’ve met Ricky, I really haven’t looked back.”  Busy with wedding plans (the couple are looking at a date next fall), Bischoff says she nonetheless has positive associations with the show. “It’s sad that it ended the way it had to end, but I was still looking for that perfect someone. I didn’t let my past close off my heart.

"""Angelina Jolie Opens Up to PEOPLE About Her 'Difficult' Year: 'I Am a Little Bit Stronger' Much has changed over the last year in Angelina Jolie‘s life, but one thing has remained constant — her dedication to her children.  After filing for divorce from Brad Pitt on September 19, 2016, Jolie retreated from the spotlight to focus on her family as they work to heal from the traumatic split.  “I have had my ups and downs. I guess I am a little bit stronger,” the actress, director and philanthropist tells PEOPLE exclusively in an interview for the magazine’s new cover story. “We all have our difficult times, but as a mother you also have a responsibility first and foremost towards the kids. They are going through their formative years and everything else comes second to that.”  With her children — Maddox, 16, Pax, 13, Zahara, 12, Shiloh, 11, Vivienne and Knox, 9 — by her side, the superstar, 42, is back at work promoting First They Killed My Father, a movie she directed for Netflix (debuting Sept. 15) based on her friend Loung Ung’s memoir about surviving the Khmer Rouge genocide in Cambodia.  Image zoom Alexei† Hay/Netflix  For all the details on Jolie’s new life, her emotional movie First They Killed My Father and her hopes for her kids, pick up the latest issue of PEOPLE, on newsstands Friday.  RELATED VIDEO: Angelina Jolie Brings All of Her 6 Kids to Premiere of Her Latest Movie  Jolie confirmed she plans on taking on more acting roles in the future, including Maleficent 2, but says her priority remains her children and their well-being.  “Everything will be around the children,” she says. “I haven’t worked for over a year now because they needed me home. Everything was just stopped. I’m really sitting and talking with them because everything affects them. Every location, every type of project, I’m going to have to adjust it to however much they can handle.”  Image zoom  Image zoom George Pimentel/WireImage  Jolie, her kids, author Loung Ung and the young stars of First They Killed My Father at the movie’s Toronto premiere on Sept. 11.  RELATED VIDEO: Kids Interview Angelina Jolie  In the interview, an emotional Jolie also talks about how she misses her mother, Marcheline Bertrand, who died of cancer 10 years ago, more than ever —and says her own health is good “so far” after her preventative surgeries to lessen the risk of breast and ovarian cancer.  She’s very proud that Maddox and Pax got involved behind the scenes on First They Killed My Father. The movie grew from her longtime love for Cambodia, where she adopted Maddox in 2002 and where she has done humanitarian work for 14 years, establishing a foundation in Maddox’s name that helps local communities with education, health and more. “I wanted Maddox to see how extraordinary his country is,” she says of the movie.  Though they are still healing from the last year, the star says her family is out of “lockdown” and ready for new adventures.  “I think they’re itching to get out in the world again,” says Jolie. “We’ve all been a bit in lockdown and going through some things. I think it would be good to get out there and play together.”""",/home/yanwang_nuist/dev_workspace/prj_python/fnd-bootstrap/dataset/gossip/Images/gossip_test/g8T7ieaTbBFlIHdBp3tZh1e5PgI4zrf4.jpg,0.0
"""Kylie Jenner Spoiled a Major Plot Point of """"The Handmaid's Tale"""" on Instagram Fans of Kylie Jenner are used to the makeup mogul sharing her every move on social media. Unfortunately, one of her newest stories probably should have come with a spoiler alert.  Fans of The Handmaid's Tale might be a little disappointed that Kylie may have unintentionally posted a major spoiler from the series on her Story. Quit reading now if you haven't yet made it through the second season.  Thanks to Kylie, some viewers caught a glimpse of a family photo from the series that featured Fred and Serena with a baby. The picture would obviously mean that Offred aka June (Elisabeth Moss) had her child, and that the baby ended up in the custody of the couple, not June.  The picture came just as Kylie attended the show's finale party, though it was oddly enough the only Handmaids-related content posted by the star. The decision to the post the picture has drawn mixed reactions, including """"What is Kylie Jenner trying to tell us by Instagramming this creepy portrait from the Handmaid’s Tale?"""" and """"Wow If you're only a couple episodes into a Handmaid's Tale don't watch Kylie's story.""""  One follower couldn't even believe that Kylie had been the one to spoil the show, tweeting, """"I haven’t finished s2 of Handmaid’s tale yet and Kylie Jenner just dropped a spoiler out of all places to see a spoiler ffs I’ve been avoiding everywhere."""" Thankfully, this Twitter user found a way to laugh about the incident, writing, """"Big mood is Kylie Jenner posting the complete family portrait of The Waterford’s from The Handmaid’s Tale on her IG story.""""  Although some viewers were rightfully a little upset, others definitely enjoyed the idea that they shared a binge-watch favorite with the celeb. """"TIL that Kylie Jenner also watches The Handmaid’s Tale so she won some cool points,"""" one person shared. And one Twitter follower could even relate to the Kylie's love of the show, tweeting, """"Kylie fangirling over The Handmaid’s Tale is me af.""""  Whether Kylie secretly meant anything by the photo or she was just excited to be at the premiere remains unclear, but as Noah Schnapp of Stranger Things recently demonstrated, sometimes, spoilers just happen.

"""Kevin Federline wants $60K in monthly child support from Britney Spears Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window)  Kevin Federline wants to triple the $20,000 in monthly child support he receives from Britney Spears.  Federline, 40, claims that Spears’ increased earnings compared with his decreasing income create “an extreme disparity” in their sons’ lifestyles from her home to his, documents obtained by The Blast revealed Tuesday.  Federline alleged in the documents that his work as a DJ nets him less than 1 percent of Spears’ reported $34 million income because he is “less of a name” than he was in 2008 when he took in six figures.  The former backup dancer claims he earns roughly $3,000 per month but that he doesn’t know how much Spears, 36, truly earns because she has allegedly refused to turn over her tax returns or reveal her income.  The couple, who were married from 2004 to 2007, agreed at the time that Spears would make $20,000 monthly child support payments to Federline for sons Sean Preston, 12, and Jayden James, 11. She also gave him $1.3 million at the time of their split.  Spears agreed to the terms through her father, Jamie, who controls her finances through a conservatorship to this day following her highly publicized breakdown in 2007.  Since then, she’s landed two lucrative Las Vegas residencies, gone on tour, released four new albums, five compilation albums, 18 fragrances and a lingerie line.  Federline laments in the documents that “[Spears] is a single woman who lives alone in a 13,264 square foot Neoclassical Italianate villa on 21 acres of land in a gated community with an elevator, a library, a media/game room, 3,500 bottle wine cellar, an additional 1,200 square foot pool house, an orchard, resort-sized pool and spa, lighted tennis court and three-green golf course. In contrast, Respondent lives with his wife, his two minor children from his current marriage, the two minor children he shares with Petitioner and two minor children from a previous relationship in a 2,000 square foot home.”  He claims that Spears (who’s currently dating hunky fitness junkie Sam Asghari) offers the boys amenities including private chefs, tutors, nannies and other staff, as well as the best toys and gadgets available and that he simply can’t keep up with their luxuries in his 2,000-square-foot home, in which his wife Victoria Prince, their two children and his two children from ex-wife Shar Jackson all live.  Federline has previously rejected attempts to settle the child support battle without litigation.  “It’s their position that they don’t have to turn over Britney’s financial information, including tax returns, which is required under the California family code. It’s not California celebrity code edition, she has to comply,” Federline’s lawyer, Mark Vincent Kaplan, told Us Weekly Tuesday. “This is the choice they have made, and they will now have to deal with it. We are still open to try and settling this without judicial intervention.”  Neither a rep nor an attorney for Spears immediately returned a request for comment.""",/home/yanwang_nuist/dev_workspace/prj_python/fnd-bootstrap/dataset/gossip/Images/gossip_test/0MxgASmw4ucu63bBunTdfz0ndGzfnZRS.jpg,1.0

"""The 16 Biggest Reveals From Caitlyn Jenner’s New Memoir Grand Central Publishing  Caitlyn Jenner's long-in-the-works book The Secrets of My Life has finally arrived, and as you can guess from that title, it is indeed full of secrets — so many secrets, in fact, that it's become a point of contention with Mama Kris on Keeping Up With the Kardashians. There's nothing particularly shocking in the book (except for maybe the part where Caitlyn implies she came up with the idea for KUWTK), but it's easy to see why Kris might not approve of everything she read. Below, the book's 16 biggest reveals.    1. She felt she didn’t deserve the Arthur Ashe Courage Award. Caitlyn writes that she doesn't necessarily feel """"brave"""" because she chose to go public with her gender identity issues, despite the fact that her decision is often described that way. """"For me it was a form of cowardice to wait so long,"""" she says, adding that she doesn't think she deserved the award bestowed on her by the ESPYs back in 2015, """"but nobody would turn down such an honor.""""    2. But wants you to know that it was not a prearranged publicity stunt. Because the ESPYs took place so soon after Caitlyn's Diane Sawyer interview and Vanity Fair cover, rumors circulated that she only agreed to do the 20/20 special if she got the award. """"It is 100 percent wrong, complete bullshit,"""" Caitlyn writes. """"The actual interview took place months before I was told I would be receiving the Arthur Ashe award.""""  3. Caitlyn’s publicist first killed a story about her gender identity in the 1980s. After finding out that the New York Times had been looking """"to pin down a story"""" on Caitlyn wearing women's clothing, Caitlyn told her publicist Alan Nierob about her feelings and had him kill it. """"He pounds the crap out of the Times,"""" Caitlyn writes. """"It works.""""  4. She did a screen test for Superman but didn’t want to cut her hair for the role. """"My hair is one of the few ways I can feel my femininity, and it is these tentacles that keep me going, make me feel some tiny piece of my authentic self.""""  5. Caitlyn’s relationship with Khloé remains fractured. This much is obvious if you've seen any recent episodes of KUTWK, but according to Caitlyn, her relationship with Khloé has not fully recovered since her transition. """"Khloé has the hardest time with it,"""" she says. """"It is something Khloé and I should talk about privately, as we have on many occasions on other sensitive subjects. But we have not, although I have tried. We have not been the same since.""""  6. The Kardashians were intentionally left out of the first Diane Sawyer special. If you watched 20/20 and thought it seemed like there wasn't very much Kris and the gang, you were right. """"They are right to feel slighted,"""" says Caitlyn. """"They were slighted on purpose because of research showing that anytime a Kardashian is on television, many in the public tend to think it is a publicity stunt to make money.""""  7. During her marriage to Kris, Kris had total control over Caitlyn’s finances. According to Caitlyn, she did not have a checking account during the peak KUTWK days and her credit card purchases were """"carefully pored over.""""  8. Caitlyn really did not like O.J. Simpson. Caitlyn got to know him via Kris's friendship with Nicole Brown Simpson and never enjoyed spending time with him: """"He was the most narcissistic, egocentric, neediest asshole in the world of sports I had ever seen, and I had seen a lot of them.""""  9. Caitlyn thought O.J. was guilty, and according to Caitlyn, so did Kris and Robert Kardashian. Caitlyn says that she and Kris """"believed he had done it the minute we heard of her murder and the circumstances surrounding it."""" As for Kardashian, who died in 2003, Caitlyn claims that he once said while in a car, """"I would've been OK with it if they'd gotten him in the first trial.""""  10. Rumors that Caitlyn regretted transitioning are completely untrue. Ian Halperin, who wrote the unauthorized biography Kardashian Dynasty, claimed in 2016 that Caitlyn regretted her transition. Caitlyn slams these rumors as """"100 percent wrong and garbage and swill.""""  11. She may have been the real brains behind the KUTWK operation. In one throwaway line, Caitlyn hints that she's actually the person who came up with the idea to film the Kardashian family. """"The house is awash in puberty and adolescence and young adulthood and two parents with very different styles,"""" she writes. """"It seems to me something is there for television."""" Then, in a new paragraph: """"Kris says she is the one who came up with the idea and decided to actively pitch it to Ryan Seacrest."""" Care to weigh in, Ryan?  12. Caitlyn’s family was embarrassed by KUTWK. Caitlyn says her aunt Ellie sent a letter to her and Kris after the show debuted about how Caitlyn had become a """"disappointment"""" to her fans. """"The implication is that I have sold myself out, willingly destroyed what positive reputation I have left,"""" she writes. """"Pretty much on the mark.""""  13. But Caitlyn says her depiction on the show was more or less accurate. """"I come across in the reality show as a well-meaning but slightly doddering patriarch who has no life of his own and is subsumed by the women who surround him and only does what his wife tells him,"""" she writes. """"In other words: a totally true depiction.""""  14. Burt, Brandon, and Brody Jenner hated Caitlyn’s Vanity Fair cover. Caitlyn says it had less to do with the photograph being """"risqué"""" and more to do with the fact that she """"did not gauge how a son would feel seeing his father in a cream-colored bustier.""""  15. Kim was a little disappointed that Caitlyn spelled her name with a """"C."""" Caitlyn's recollection of this conversation makes it seem like Kim was joking, but Caitlyn also had this to say about Kim even asking about it: """"Spoken like a true Kardashian.""""  16. Caitlyn had gender confirmation surgery, which she calls """"the Final Surgery,"""" in January 2017. While this is not something a transgender person ever has an obligation to discuss (and Caitlyn herself reiterates several times that it's no one's business but the person who's having it), Caitlyn says she chose to include it because she wanted to be able to stop talking about it. """"I feel not only wonderful but liberated,"""" she writes. """"I am telling you because I believe in candor. So all of you can stop staring. You want to know, so now you know. Which is why this is the first time, and the last time, I will ever speak of it.""""  Follow Eliza on Twitter.

"""Maddox Jolie Pitt Reportedly Begging To Live With Brad Pitt Instead Of ‘Instigator’ Angelina Jolie Maddox Jolie-Pitt is not happy with his mom, Angelina Jolie, after she visited the grave of Pol Pot – the murderous dictator responsible for killing 3 million Cambodians – and now he has defiantly demanded to live with his dad, Brad Pitt. Sources say that after he found out about his mother’s visit, the Cambodian-born Jolie Pitt immediately called his dad and begged to live with him.  Pol Pot’s Khmer Rouge party ruled Cambodia from 1975 to 1979 and slaughtered millions through starvation, work camps, and mass executions on the notorious “killing fields.” Locals say that Jolie has visited the grave multiple times, the first being in 1998, and then again in 2001 during the trip where she adopted Maddox.  Angelina Jolie Takes Her Kids to the Toronto International Film Festival–but Maddox Jolie-Pitt Is Noticeably M.I.A. https://t.co/y3cw9EAJFE — E! News (@enews) September 11, 2017  “Brad tried to soothe him, saying Angie is interested in the history of the country where she found Maddox,” reveals an insider. “He also explained that he needs to be careful while the pair’s lawyers work out custody of all their kids — and to hold tight until he could speak with her about it.”  Ironically, it was Maddox who got into a physical confrontation with Pitt back in September 2016 during that infamous flight that led to the couple’s split. Jolie claimed this was evidence of Pitt’s abusive behavior towards their six children.  But now, according to Radar Online, the 16-year-old understands that his mom’s behavior ignited problems in their family, and it is the 42-year-old actress who is the instigator of many of their family woes.  The fact that Jolie visits the warlord’s resting place is “galling” to Maddox, according to insiders, and he doesn’t understand how she could save him from such an evil place and then return to it like it is a shrine. But, whether Maddox winds up with Pitt is still in question.  Pitt and Jolie are still in the middle of hashing out a custody agreement and divorce settlement, but a year and a half after their split, Pitt is happy again and in “high spirits.” After taking time to focus on himself, the 54-year-old has slowly made his way back into the spotlight and is currently dating Neri Oxman, who is a professor of media arts and sciences at the MIT Media Lab.  His separation from Jolie was a sad and shocking situation for Pitt, but he has started taking  “Separating was very sad and shocking to him, but he started taking care of himself again,” says an insider. “He seems much, much happier.”  Pitt met Oxman through an architecture project at MIT last fall, and since then he has been making regular trips to the east coast to spend time with the new woman in his life.

"""Gavin Rossdale: ‘If you divorce America's sweetheart, you're in trouble’ Better known as Gwen Stefani’s ex than as a rock singer, he’s now trying his hand as a judge on The Voice UK. He discusses Marilyn, Bush and a private life in the public eye  About an hour into Gavin Rossdale’s new job as a judge on The Voice UK, the ITV producers had a word in his ear.  “They asked me to up the energy, because I was a bit laidback,” he admits. “But then I’ve been told that for years on TV. I’d meet these presenters that were really loud and I’d think: ‘Why are you being so annoying?’ And then I’d watch it on TV and I’d look half-dead and they look normal.”  It’s understandable if Rossdale seems slightly low-energy today. He has been working since 5am, and for a large part of that time he has been forced to interact with the British press. For years, the UK music mags tore into his band Bush – mocking his private school upbringing and his embracing of angsty American grunge just as Britpop was sweeping that sound away over here. More recently, Rossdale has been tabloid gossip fodder – the ex-husband of Gwen Stefani who allegedly wronged her by sleeping with the nanny. And yet here he is, having to play nice for the same publications.  “I felt like a rag doll” is how he describes the experience. “I was not really saying anything and just waiting for them to cut me up like a sushi chef one more time.”  It hasn’t escaped my mind that Rossdale is sitting here talking to … a member of the British press. He’s polite and engaged, but he doesn’t trust me very much. Most journalists, he says, are nice to his face – “because I’m bigger than they think I am” – but end up stitching him up when they get behind their keyboard. I glance at the gleaming triangular ring on his finger, which would double neatly as a knuckle duster, and wonder how this encounter might go …  Facebook Twitter Pinterest Will.i.am, Jennifer Hudson, Sir Tom Jones and Gavin Rossdale. Photograph: Joel Anderson/ITV  Rossdale was not an obvious choice for the UK version of The Voice. A massive rock star in the US who has shifted about 20m albums, he has been a comparative flop back home. He admits he was shocked to get the call – “I thought I was being punk’d!” – and a fair few “Who is Gavin Rossdale?” pieces made their way to publication.  Does he see the irony in being asked to coach UK pop stars when he struggled to make an impact here?  “For sure,” he says, grinning. “The reason why Bush never got signed at first was always that I couldn’t sing. But I believe great singers become great singers.”  Rossdale is a quiet presence on the show – perhaps a little nervous at first – but he scares the other judges with his smooth talk and his ability to win over contestants and convince them to join his team. In a canny twist by the show’s producers, his ex-wife judges on the US version. But Rossdale says other reasons are behind his desire to appear on it. Bush have a new album out in early 2017; this could be one last, unexpected, opportunity to try to break Britain. “I was clearly at peace with not having [done so],” he says, “but I always felt it was unfortunate we weren’t given the exposure that could have led to a few more people knowing about us,” he says.  I wonder what it must have been like, playing enormodomes in the US and then returning home to play pub shows to nobody, but Rossdale says it wasn’t like that: “We were having really killer shows [in the UK], but then getting destroyed in the reviews.” I never played shows here that weren’t packed, that weren’t full of people having an amazing time … well, apart from whoever was writing the review.”  Facebook Twitter Pinterest Swallowed, Bush’s biggest hit in the UK.  What was the worst thing anyone ever wrote about him?  “Oh, God, it just went on and on,” he says. “I stopped reading it, which was a much better decision by me. I still don’t. I had to tell my new manager to stop sending me press cuttings recently, but he’s still doing it.”  Even in the US, the press could be snarky. When Rossdale made the cover of Rolling Stone in 1996, the topless shot of him ran alongside the cover line: “Why won’t anyone take Gavin Rossdale seriously?” Is it true he had the cover framed, but pointedly crossed out the cover line? “It’s the only cover I’ve ever seen them insult anyone,” he sighs. “But I’m sorry, that’s not true. I wouldn’t bother framing a Rolling Stone magazine, although people do still ask me to sign it occasionally. And I always sign over the word ‘seriously’ and replace it with ‘to lunch’.”  The next morning, I meet Rossdale after another early start – he has just finished a This Morning interview, in which he seemed overjoyed to have met Philip Schofield (“He’s been on screen all my life!”). There’s no low energy today. We zip through Rossdale’s early life as a “painfully shy” outsider living out various dual roles simultaneously: he schooled at the ultra-posh Westminster College, yet hung around with football casuals from the estates near his Swiss Cottage home. He spent a couple of teenage weekends in an East End pub, serving jellied eels to gangsters and learning to double-salt the crisps so that punters drank more. Yet by 16 he had run away to start a new life – music was his main solace and he ended up frequenting hedonistic clubs such as Taboo and the Wag Club.  Facebook Twitter Pinterest Photograph: Graeme Robertson for the Guardian  It was around this time that he met the popstar Marilyn, who has said they had a love affair he never got over, although Rossdale describes the suggestions it lasted for five years as “complete nonsense”. He continues: “I knew him for five minutes. You hang out with people and, when you’re young, you find out what you want … and that just wasn’t my world. I’m the biggest libertarian on earth, I have no qualms with anyone doing anything ... I couldn’t care less if you want to sleep with a telephone.”  Being asked about Marilyn is the closest Rossdale gets to angry during the interview – he says he’s fed up having to talk about something he considers inconsequential that happened decades ago. I notice he’s still wearing the spiked ring from yesterday.  “I wear it as my armour against you!” He swivels it around so that the spike is within his hand. “This is the friendly side,” he says – symbolically, I think, but then he swivels it back into spike mode.  “I’m not actually a violent person,” he says. “And I am fully aware that I have an incredible life and I should be grateful and shut the fuck up. I have no complaints, really. I mean, of course I have complaints, I have loads of complaints – I got divorced! It was the worst time of my life ever!”  Facebook Twitter Pinterest Gavin Rossdale, Nigel Pulsford, David Guy Parsons and Robin Goodridge of Bush. Photograph: Mick Hutson/Redferns  Was he aware of how negative the press was about him?  “Well, if you divorce America’s sweetheart, you’re in trouble. Or rather, if she divorces me. So … I don’t read that stuff, but I know I’ve been portrayed as a bad guy.” Rossdale says his priority is his kids, so he would never say anything bad about her publicly. “She’s the mother of my children and one of the most incredible girls in the world.”  Are they still talking?  “She has a boyfriend and she’s busy … but I wish her all the happiness in the world, and that’s the true sign of love. As I’m sure your favourite artist Sting said: ‘If you love someone, set them free.’” Last year, Stefani released This Is What The Truth Feels Like, which dealt with their split in forensic detail: “I don’t know why I cry/ But I think it’s ’cause I remembered for the first time/ Since I hated you/ That I used to love you”, she sang on Used To Love You. Has Rossdale heard it?  “Erm,” he says, pausing for a while. “You know, I did hear it the other day in an airport.” He trails off for a moment. “Now I’m talking about Gwen more than I intended to. Fucking journalists! But, yeah, I walked through the airport and they had one of those little kiosks playing it and I heard the song about how she used to love me. So I stood in the store and listened to it from beginning to end going: ‘Okaaaay.’”  Facebook Twitter Pinterest Rossdale with Gwen Stefani. Photograph: Charbonneau/BEI/BEI/Shutterstock  What did he think?  “As a songwriter, I thought it was an interesting lyrical twist.” I assume he’s being evasive, but then I notice his eyes are filling up a bit: “It’s a lot,” he says. “Divorce is a lot.”  Was it horrible to hear Stefani singing about it?  “Well, I’m not sure what the parameters are,” he says, composing himself again. “It could only really be horrible, tragic or terrible, right? That’s the range. It never really moves into joy or satisfaction, does it?”  It might move into anger …  “Oh, no. Because I live in a glass house in a glass room in a glass bed with a glass bathroom. So I don’t say anything about anyone. If she had to do that, if she needed to do it, that’s her perspective and everyone has that. It’s just that … look, it’s bad enough getting divorced, but getting divorced publicly from her was fucking next level. But what do I know? Here we are discussing this against the Oxo Tower, and London is beautiful, the sun is shining and it’s the worst thing if you think about suicide, because people pass, they die and they go, and yet life goes on …”  I’m taken aback. Suicide?  “Life is like waterskiing,” he continues – and I’m not sure either of us know where he’s going at this point – “in the sense that you’ve got to make sure you don’t let go of the rope. And I didn’t let go of the rope. But if one year ago you said I’d be doing this, and I’d have a record that I have and the support that I have … it’s been a dark time.”  Facebook Twitter Pinterest Photograph: Graeme Robertson for the Guardian  Did he consider suicide?  “No, because I have children … but there were times when I 100% understood why people do it.”  Despite not trusting journalists, Rossdale turns out to be good company – funny and full of statements suitably ludicrous for a pop star (“Was I tired yesterday? No, because I’m a fucking warrior and I will outlast anyone at anything”) yet vulnerable and far more self-aware than I’d anticipated (“It’s all you want to know, really, let’s face it,” he says after the barrage of questions about Stefani. “I mean, what’s the new record like? Yawn!”).  I wonder if this more relaxed, honest version of Rossdale is one that not many people get to see. As we leave, he tells me that Stefani often didn’t want him opening up to the press, so he learned to stay guarded. But now he has a degree of freedom to do what he wants – he mentions on a couple of occasions about wanting to “become 3D”, so that people can go beyond the headlines and see who he really is: “And then be like … yeah, now I really don’t like him,” he laughs.  And how would he feel if people still didn’t like him? Or if the Bush album doesn’t take off? If all this amounts to nothing in the end?  “I just got divorced and I’m still alive,” he says. “So nothing can crush me. Nothing!”  The Voice UK is on Saturdays, 8pm, ITV""",/home/yanwang_nuist/dev_workspace/prj_python/fnd-bootstrap/dataset/gossip/Images/gossip_test/p9QKn4JeJoGT3PrgyZDJWXAnPY5pBHhJ.jpg,1.0
"""Ocean's 8 2018 film by Gary Ross  Ocean's 8 (stylized onscreen as Ocean's Eight) is a 2018 American heist comedy film directed by Gary Ross and written by Ross and Olivia Milch. The film is both a continuation and a spin-off from Steven Soderbergh's Ocean's trilogy and features an ensemble cast, including Sandra Bullock, Cate Blanchett, Anne Hathaway, Mindy Kaling, Sarah Paulson, Rihanna, Helena Bonham Carter, and Awkwafina. The film follows a group of women led by Debbie Ocean, the sister of Danny Ocean, who plan a sophisticated heist of the annual Met Gala at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City.  After the release of Ocean's Thirteen in 2007, Soderbergh stated he had no intentions of making a fourth film, citing his desire to have the series """"go out on top"""". However, an all-female spin-off was announced in October 2015, with much of the cast signing on by August 2016. Filming took place from October 2016 to March 2017 around New York City.  Ocean's 8 premiered at Alice Tully Hall on June 5, 2018, and was released by Warner Bros. Pictures in the United States on June 8, 2018, 11 years to the day of the release of Ocean's Thirteen. The film grossed $297 million worldwide and received a lukewarm response from critics, who applauded the chemistry of the cast but found the movie undemanding and less consistent than the films in Soderbergh's trilogy.  Plot [ edit ]  Newly paroled con artist Debbie Ocean – the """"late"""" Danny Ocean's younger sister – convinces former partner-in-crime Lou to join her in a new heist. They assemble their team: bankrupt fashion designer Rose Weil; jewelry maker Amita, eager to move out of her mother's house; hacker Nine Ball; street hustler and pickpocket Constance; and profiteer Tammy, who fences stolen goods out of her suburban home.  Debbie plans to steal the Toussaint, a $150 million Cartier necklace, during the upcoming Met Gala and use movie star Daphne Kluger as a mule. The team manipulates Daphne into hiring Weil, and convince Cartier to loan Daphne the Toussaint. They digitally scan the necklace to manufacture a cubic zirconia duplicate. Tammy secures a job at Vogue and gains access to the gala, and Debbie leads Daphne to invite art dealer Claude Becker, whose betrayal sent Debbie to prison, as her date. Lou confronts Debbie for planning revenge against Becker, but Debbie reassures her this is not the case.  When Rose learns the Toussaint can only be unclasped by a special magnet carried by the bodyguards hired by Cartier, Nine Ball enlists her younger sister Veronica's help in defeating the mechanism. At the gala, Lou spikes Daphne's soup, causing her to vomit in the restroom, a blind spot to the Met's cameras created by Nine Ball. Constance removes the necklace and sneaks it to Amita, who splits it into smaller pieces of jewelry. The Toussaint's disappearance triggers the museum's evacuation, but the search ends when Tammy """"finds"""" the duplicate necklace. Constance slips the Toussaint pieces to the team to smuggle out; Debbie plants a piece on Becker. After the heist, Debbie and Lou reveal Daphne had been in on the plan.  Cartier discovers the recovered necklace is a fake, and dispatches insurance investigator John Frazier. Having crossed paths with the Oceans before, Frazier immediately suspects Debbie, but her careful presence on the gala's video footage gives her an unbeatable alibi. She tells Frazier she may know who stole the necklace. Daphne visits Becker and sends Frazier a picture of the jewel Debbie planted. To further frame Becker, Debbie hires actresses posing as elderly socialites to sell the Toussaint pieces and deposit the money in Becker's name. Frazier takes Becker into custody.  As the eight celebrate their victory, Lou reveals the heist's true target: while the gala was being evacuated, she and """"The Amazing"""" Yen replaced a Met display of royal jewels with replicas, escaping with gems even more valuable than the Toussaint. With a larger-than-expected share of the score, each member of the team goes her separate way: Amita travels to Paris with a man she meets on Tinder; Weil pays off her debts and opens her own store; Constance buys a spacious loft in the city and becomes a YouTuber; Tammy expands her business in stolen goods; Nine Ball opens a pool bar; Daphne becomes a film director; Lou goes on a cross-country road trip; and Debbie visits Danny's grave with a martini in his honor.  Cast [ edit ]  Additionally, Dakota Fanning appears as Penelope Stern, a celebrity who Kluger is jealous of, and Nathanya Alexander appears as Veronica, Nine Ball's younger sister.[4] Elliott Gould and Qin Shaobo reprise their roles from the previous films as Reuben Tishkoff and """"The Amazing"""" Yen, respectively. Matt Damon and Carl Reiner were also set to reprise their respective characters Linus Caldwell and Saul Bloom, but their scenes were cut.[5][6] Marlo Thomas, Dana Ivey, Mary Louise Wilson and Elizabeth Ashley appear as elderly actresses who help the crew shift their stolen gems.[7] Celebrities who cameo as themselves in the film include Anna Wintour, Zayn Malik, Katie Holmes, Maria Sharapova, Serena Williams, Kim Kardashian, Common, Adriana Lima, Desiigner, Kylie Jenner, Alexander Wang, Kendall Jenner, Ira Glass, Gigi Hadid, Lily Aldridge, Olivia Munn, Jaime King, Zac Posen, Hailey Baldwin, Derek Blasberg, Sofia Richie, Heidi Klum, Kelly Rohrbach, and Lauren Santo Domingo.[8][9]  Production [ edit ]  After the release of Ocean's Thirteen, Steven Soderbergh stated that there would not be an Ocean's Fourteen, noting that George Clooney wanted """"to go out strong"""" with the third film.[10] In December 2008, Soderbergh again said that a fourth film in the franchise was unlikely, this time citing the recent death of Bernie Mac, who had appeared in the earlier films.[11] However, a female focused spin-off starring Sandra Bullock was in development as of October 2015.[12][13] Helena Bonham Carter, Cate Blanchett, Mindy Kaling, and Elizabeth Banks were later announced to star in the film,[14] though Banks' presence turned out to be a rumor that did not materialize.[15]  In August 2016, Bullock, Blanchett, Bonham Carter and Kaling were confirmed to star, with Anne Hathaway, Rihanna, Awkwafina, and Sarah Paulson closing deals to fill the cast.[16][17] During production on the film, Dakota Fanning and Damian Lewis were spotted on set, with Lewis's casting being confirmed in December 2016 and Fanning confirming her casting in March 2017. However, Lewis does not appear in the finished film.[18][19][20]  On November 11, 2016, Richard Robichaux was also cast in the film.[21] That same month, Matt Damon stated he would appear in the film, reprising his role from the Ocean's Trilogy;[22][23][24] however, his scene was not included in the finished film. In January 2017, James Corden joined the cast as an insurance broker who begins to grow suspicious of the group.[25] That same month, it was revealed Anna Wintour, Alexander Wang, Zac Posen, Derek Blasberg, Lauren Santo Domingo, Kim Kardashian, Kendall Jenner, Kylie Jenner, Katie Holmes, Olivia Munn, Hailey Baldwin and Zayn Malik were announced to cameo in the film.[26][27][28][29][30] That same month, Richard Armitage joined the cast of the film.[31]  Principal photography on the film began on October 25, 2016, in New York City.[32][33] In March 2017, Blanchett said production had officially been completed.[34]  On May 5, 2017, it was announced that filming would continue on Staten Island at the former Arthur Kill Correctional Facility, which Broadway Stages was in the process of acquiring after an initial rejection.[35]  Box office [ edit ]  After premiering at Alice Tully Hall in New York City on June 5, 2018,[36] Ocean's 8 was released by Warner Bros. to theaters in North America on June 8.[37][38] Ocean's 8 grossed $140.2 million in the United States and Canada, and $157.5 million in other territories, for a total worldwide gross of $297.7 million, against a production budget of $70 million.[3]  In the United States and Canada, Ocean's 8 was released alongside Hotel Artemis and Hereditary, and was projected to gross around $45 million from 4,145 theaters in its opening weekend, although some tracking firms had it debuting with as low as $30 million. Deadline Hollywood noted that it was tracking on-par with the 2016 all-female Ghostbusters reboot (which opened to $46 million), and had more interest from audiences than the likes of fellow female-led comedies The Heat ($39.1 million debut), Spy ($29.1 million) and Girls Trip ($31.2 million).[39] The film made $4 million from Thursday night previews, including $100,000 from additional early screenings Wednesday night, and $15.8 million on its first day (including previews). It went on to debut to $41.6 million, 69% of its audience was female.[40][41] In its second weekend the film made $19 million, finishing second behind newcomer Incredibles 2.[42] In its third weekend the film earned $11.7 million, finishing third behind Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom and Incredibles 2.[43]  Overseas the film was released in 16 countries alongside the United States and made $12.2 million in its opening weekend. Its largest markets were Australia ($4.7 million), Mexico ($2.6 million) and Brazil ($1.7 million).[44] By its third week of release (where it made $26.9 million), the film had an international total of $70.9 million. Its largest markets were United Kingdom ($14 million), Australia ($13.6 million), Japan ($11.7 million), South Korea ($10.8 million), Germany ($7.4 million), Mexico ($6.3 million), and Brazil ($5.6 million).[45]  Home media [ edit ]  Ocean's 8 was first released on Digital HD on August 21, 2018.[46] Warner Bros. Home Entertainment then released the film on DVD, Blu-ray, and 4K UHD Combo Pack on September 11, 2018.[47] The film debuted at the top of the NPD VideoScan First Alert chart for the week ending on September 15, 2018.[48]  Critical reception [ edit ]  According to several media outlets, Ocean's 8 received a generally lukewarm response from critics.[49] On review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 69% based on 323 reviews, and an average rating of 6.24/10. The website's critical consensus reads, """"Ocean's 8 isn't quite as smooth as its predecessors, but still has enough cast chemistry and flair to enjoyably lift the price of a ticket from filmgoers up for an undemanding caper.""""[50] At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating to reviews, the film has a weighted average score of 61 out of 100, based on reviews from 50 critics, indicating """"generally favorable reviews"""".[51] According to BBC News, while critical reviews of the film were """"broadly positive"""", """"most had some reservations"""".[52] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of """"B+"""" on an A+ to F scale, the same score earned by Ocean's Eleven and Thirteen.[40]  Writing for Rolling Stone, Peter Travers gave the film 3 out of 4 stars and praised the cast (namely Bullock, Blanchett and Hathaway), saying, """"Ocean's 8 is a heist caper that looks gorgeous, keeps the twists coming and bounces along on a comic rhythm that's impossible to resist. What more do you want in summer escapism?""""[53] Alonso Duralde of TheWrap called the film """"slick, charming and funny,"""" though added it never quite kicks into high gear"""" and said, """"Cinematographer Eigil Bryld gives the proceedings the high-gloss of a SkyMall catalog, which is appropriate for a movie about robbing a legendary Cartier necklace at fashion's most exclusive event...And between the sheen and the talented performers, Ocean's 8 does eventually coast on froth and good will.""""[54]  Variety's Owen Gleiberman said it is """"clever enough to get by"""" and wrote """"Ocean's 8 is a casually winning heist movie, no more and no less, but like countless films devoted to the exploits of cool male criminals, it lingers most...as a proudly scurrilous gallery of role models."""" He found Hathaway """"commanding at every moment"""" and believed Bullock projected """"the debauched insolence"""" and ideological drive of """"a hungry criminal"""", but lamented the scarcity of impressive dialogue for Paulson and Blanchett, who """"don't get a chance to create indelible characters"""".[55] In The Boston Globe, Ty Burr was more impressed by Blanchett's performance (""""the Boss of This Movie"""") and said, apart from Hathaway, the film largely depended on the """"established personas"""" of the actors.[56]  Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune gave the film 2 out of 4 stars and said, """"Some movies are more about parallel play than actual playground interaction, and despite a screenful of terrifically skillful talents, Ocean's 8 never quite gets its ensemble act together. It's smooth, and far from inept. But it isn't much fun. That's all you want from a certain kind of heist picture, isn't it? Fun?""""[57] Writing for the Chicago Sun-Times, Richard Roeper said the cast """"banters beautifully, but the heist is a bit too breezy"""", lacking a """"formidable, hiss-worthy villain"""" and """"darker, more challenging, more nuanced adventure"""".[58]  Response from actors [ edit ]  Kaling and Blanchett attributed the lukewarm reception to the dominance of male critics and a lack of diversity among mainstream film reviewers. In an interview with Yahoo! Movies, Kaling cited actress Meryl Streep's criticism of Rotten Tomatoes and said, """"There is obviously an audience out there who want to watch things like [Ocean's 8], what I work on, what Sarah [Paulson] works on ...

Guy Lodge, a chief film critic for Variety, highlighted the fact that several female reviewers, including Emily Yoshida from Vulture and Time magazine's Stephanie Zacharek, concurred with the general lukewarm response.[49] Justin Chang, an Asian-American critic for the Los Angeles Times, argued that film criticism needed increased diversity, but """"We negate the possibility of sympathetic imagination when we assume that someone’s particular affinity for a work of art will be dictated in advance by specifics of race, gender and age."""" He instead argued that the benefits would be a broader pool of talent and perspectives.[59] Donald Clarke from The Irish Times pointed out that film had received a """"fresh"""" rating on Rotten Tomatoes, and a better score than Ocean's Twelve.[60]  Accolades [ edit ]""",/home/yanwang_nuist/dev_workspace/prj_python/fnd-bootstrap/dataset/gossip/Images/gossip_test/pbv9wypGMGiK4EYMyOHWwGAwWan7u2sf.jpg,0.0
"""Here's why those Taylor Swift courtroom drawings were so terrible Do you think this looks like Taylor Swift? Neilson Barnard/Getty Images for Tommy Hilfiger, AP Photo/Jeff Kandyba  It may be easy to conjure an image of Taylor Swift to mind, but drawing the superstar singer is apparently more difficult than it looks.  After receiving criticism for his courtroom sketches of Swift during her trial against Denver-based JD David Mueller for an alleged assault in 2013, the artist behind the drawings is speaking out saying the singer is just too pretty to capture in a courtroom sketch.  """"A person like Taylor Swift, who is very pretty — has perfectly proportioned dimensions on the face — is actually much harder [to sketch],"""" Jeff Kandyba, a Boulder-based artist who has been sketching in courtrooms since the '80s told Fox 31 Denver.

"""Hanson brothers compare Justin Bieber’s music to chlamydia Becoming a big star in any field at a young age can usually screw somebody up, but for the Hanson boys, it seems like the success of “MMMBop” 25 years ago just made them very particular about music. They’ve kind of earned the right to be a bit snobbish, since they did put out a massively popular song a very long time ago, but everybody should make a point to avoid getting on Hanson’s bad side because those boys can be vicious. Last year, they felt the need to declare that nobody has ever made a good cover of “MMMBop,” and now they’ve fired a classic Hanson burn in the direction of a slightly more relevant artist who also used to be an adorable teenage moppet.  As reported by Page Six, the Hansons appeared on an Australian radio station recently and played a self-explanatory game called “Whose Song Is It Anyway?” with the program’s hosts. The Hanson boys weren’t confident in their abilities, though, noting that they don’t listen to a lot of “modern” music. That became evident as the game progressed, with the brothers failing to recognize Justin Bieber’s remix of the song “Despacito.” When they discovered that Bieber was involved with the track, one of the Hansons admitted that he was “glad” that he couldn’t recognize it, adding, “I prefer not to get any venereal diseases so whenever Justin Bieber gets near me or near my ears…it’s just ear infections, they’re terrible.” They later referred to this phenomenon as “chlamydia of the year” and noted that “it sucks.”  Advertisement  Hopefully, Justin Bieber will fire back with some kind of a mean burn of his own, at which point all of these cute boys can finally jump into a full-blown feud.""",/home/yanwang_nuist/dev_workspace/prj_python/fnd-bootstrap/dataset/gossip/Images/gossip_test/TTFaycjW94gWxOrcEPyhCg5EZss3DvK0.jpg,0.0
"""Ivanka Trump Sat in for Dad at G20 Meeting and Twitter Is Not Having It Ivanka Trump sat in place of her father at a G-20 Summit meeting with world leaders on Saturday, and social media is unloading on her for it.  Donald Trump's daughter is being slammed for taking her dad's place in the meeting. Ivanka, who has a White House job as her one of her father's key advisors, was apparently told to take his place in the meeting while he briefly exited the room.  A Russian official tweeted (and then deleted) a photograph of Ivanka Trump sitting in between British Prime Minister Theresa May and Chinese President Xi Jinping. The move was heavily criticized, as a BBC correspondent noted that when a President isn't available to take his seat in meeting for whatever reason, it is usually filled by a high-ranking member of his office.

"""Katy Perry slams Lionel Richie on Jimmy Kimmel Live! It appears there's drama at the American Idol judges table already.  Katy Perry, who will be joined by Luke Bryant and Lionel Richie in hosting the revamped competition series, appeared on Jimmy Kimmel Live! on Monday to promote the show. During the appearance she told host Jimmy Kimmel she and Luke are thick as thieves, but it seems there's a rift between them and their 68-year-old co-judge.  'We respect him just about as much as his kids respect him. Which is not a lot,' the Roar singer said while appearing on the late night show.  Katy Perry fired shots at American Idol co-host Lionel Richie during Jimmy Kimmel Live!  The comment appears to refer to something the musician previously made about his youngest daughter, Sofia Richie, dating Scott Disick. It's been widely reported that Lionel doesn't approve of his 19-year-old daughter's relationship with the troubled 34-year-old.  Katy's jabs didn't stop there, however. Speaking with the Jimmy Kimmel Live! host she nitpicked the way Lionel critiques American Idol contestants. The award-winning musician said Lionel often recalls working with music legends in long-winded stories comparable to 'Ted Talks'.  Katy doesn't just make snide remarks behind Lionel's back, though. She and her country musician co-judge, Luke, have been known to play a prank or two on the legendary musician, according to her Jimmy Kimmel appearance. She revealed on the show that they put whoopee cushions on his seat when he stands up to provide feedback to competitors.  'We're ruining his legacy,' she said.  Before American Idol fans get too bummed about this on-set beef, it's worth noting that Katy also said during her appearance that Lionel is actually like 'an uncle' to her and her fellow judge.  'He's an uncle you want in your house telling you all these wonderful historical stories and he does have some tea but we can't put that on TV,' she said.  Although there may be no actual feud on the set of American Idol, there's plenty of other drama rumored to be going down behind the judging table.  According to TMZ, Katy's left American Idol executives 'frustrated' with her repeated late arrivals on the set during auditions. Per the publication's report, she's 'almost always late' by about 10 or 15 minutes.  Producers are also said to be worried about a lack of 'comedic tension' on the show. The outlet reported that the panel are 'not at each other's throats, either in a serious or runny way', which has created worries about ratings.

"""Kim Cattrall says Sex and the City stars are toxic Kim Cattrall has given just a handful of sit-down interviews in the two decades since 'Sex and the City' first premiered on HBO, with the actress having long been fiercely protective of her private and professional relationships.  That all changed on Monday night however, when Cattrall took a seat opposite Piers Morgan for a taping of the ITV series 'Life Stories.'  The 61-year-old actress was appearing on the program just days after multiple sources told DailyMailTV that he outrageous demands had led to Warner Bros. cancelling plans for a third 'Sex and the City' film, a claim she flat out denied.  Cattrall then used the interview to open up about Sarah Jessica Parker, Cynthia Nixon and Kristen Davis for the first time, call her relationship with the women 'toxic.'  And in a move that would no doubt leave her publicist character Samantha Jones reeling, Cattrall went on to say that the only thing she ever had in common with her on-screen pals was the fact that they all starred in the critically-acclaimed and publicly-adored series.  Scroll down for video  Story time: Kim Cattrall sat down with Piers Morgan (above) for an interview on Monday night that will air on the ITV series 'Life Stories'  Too high, can't come down: Cattrall said her relationship with the three women she co-starred with on 'Sex and the City' was 'toxic' (l to r: Sarah Jessica Parker, Cynthia Nixon and Kristin Davis in 2010)  Losin' my head: 'The common ground that we had was the series and the series is over,' said Cattrall (Parker and Davis in 2015 on left, Nixon and Parker in 2017 on right)  Spinnin' round and round: Davis shared a snap of herself and Nixon last month in front of a 'Sex and the City' sketch (above)  Cattrall told Morgan on Monday that having a relationship with the other women was difficult on account of the fact she leads a very different life and has different priorities than her co-stars.  'They all have children and I am ten years older and since specifically the series ended I have been spending most of my time outside of New York so I don't see them,' said Cattrall.  'The common ground that we had was the series and the series is over.'  Cattrall went on to note: 'I've moved on, this is what my sixties are about, they're about me making decisions for me not my career, for me. And that feels frickin fantastic.'  She quickly added: 'But everything comes to an end and in closing one door another door opens and that door has been waiting for a long time.'  Parker is 52 and has been married to actor Matthew Broderick for 20 years, with whom she has three children: teenager son James and twin daughters Marion and Tabitha, 8, who were born via surrogate.  Nixon is 51 and has been married to wife Christine Marinoni for five years.  The education activist gave birth to the couple's son Max in 2011, and Nixon has a son Charles,14, and daughter Samantha, 21, from her previous relationship with partner Danny Mozes.  Davis is 52 and in 2011 adopted her daughter Gemma. She ad Cattrall are both single, though Davis has never before been married while her older co-star has twice walked down the aisle.  Chain gang: Parker is 52 and has been married to actor Matthew Broderick for 20 years, with whom she has three children: teenager son James and twin daughters Marion and Tabitha, 8 (above in April)  Modern family: Nixon is 51 and has been married to wife Christine Marinoni for five years (couple above in 2008)  Family matters: Davis is 52 and in 2011 adopted her daughter Gemma (above in May)  Cattrall told Morgan that she had no idea when she last spoke to her co-stars, and that no one was reaching out when the reports began circulating about her holding up the film.  'And that's another thing that's really disappointing is that nobody ever picks up the phone and tries to contact you and say, 'how you doing?' That would have been the way to handle it,' said Cattrall.  'And usually what happens in a healthy relationship is that someone, or a transaction for a job in my business, is that someone says, 'are you available?' and you say 'yes' and here's the job and you say 'yes but thank you very much but I'm sort of over here right now but thank you very much' and that person turns to you and they say 'that's great, good luck to you, I wish you the best.' '  Cattrall then noted: 'That's not what happened here, this is, it feels like a toxic relationship.'  Over it: 'This is, it feels like a toxic relationship,' said Cattrall (above in May)  She also said that she would not rule out a reconciliation with Parker.  'There is genuine affection and there has been over the years,' said Cattrall.  'This is extenuating circumstances and in the past I've felt, wow, especially with the fans I don't want to in any shape or form ruin an ideal of it, because it does stand for empowerment and it does stand for women sticking up for each other, but not always.'  Cattrall did confirm to Morgan though that Samantha Jones would never again be back on screen.  'Me playing her, that I can assure you will never happen. For me it's over, it's over with no regrets, I just wish that Sarah had been nicer,' said Cattrall.  'I'm at a point in my life where I am making decisions that make me happy and going backwards in life doesn't make me happy. Going forward that's how I feel, I'm on the front foot not my backfoot.'  Cattrall also scoffed at the notion that she was ever close to signing on to the film, telling Morgan that she declined an offer to return as sex-positive publicist Samantha Jones.  'The answer was always no and a respectful, firm, no,' said Cattrall.  She then addressed some of the specific allegations reported by DailyMailTV claiming: 'I never asked for any money, I never asked for any projects, to be thought of as some kind of diva is absolutely ridiculous.'  Firing back: 'That's another thing that's really disappointing is that nobody ever picks up the phone and tries to contact you and say, """"how you doing?""""' said Cattrall (Davis, Parker and Nixon above in 2002)  Adios: 'I'm at a point in my life where I am making decisions that make me happy and going backwards in life doesn't make me happy,' said Cattrall (her costars on left in 2004 and right in 2010)  Heading to the bank: The women have certainly been valuable players to the studio. The first 'Sex and the City' film was made for $65 million and grossed $415 million worldwide while the sequel (above) brought in $300 million on a $100 million budget  The exact demands that Cattrall made were not revealed by sources, but she has certainly been a valuable player to the studio.  The first 'Sex and the City' film was made for $65 million and grossed $415 million worldwide while the sequel brought in $300 million on a $100 million budget.  Both of those films were two of the biggest profit generators for the studio that year.  Cattrall also spoke about her perceived reputation as a diva, an allegation that has circled her for years despite the fact that she avoids the limelight.  'The inference is from some unknown source, the inference is, is that I am a diva, that I've held up production in some way that, 'oh now we don't get to make our movie because of you,'' said Cattrall.  'I want them to make the movie, if that's what they want to do. It's a great part. I played it past the finish line and then some and I loved it and another actress should play it, maybe they could make it an African American Samantha Jones or a Hispanic Samantha Jones?'  Cattrall then offered up more ideas for a third installment.  'Or bring in another character. It can be another character. This is what I really believe that this franchise needs another point of view and this could be it,' said Cattrall.  'I don't feel like a victim, I feel like I came out of this on top. This has given me a fantastic platform. Sarah Jessica, she could have been nicer, she could have in some way. I don't know what her issue is, I never have.'""",/home/yanwang_nuist/dev_workspace/prj_python/fnd-bootstrap/dataset/gossip/Images/gossip_test/5MmNvrhdc18pc6YE7gBQTmmEImt0eq0g.jpg,1.0

We do not even own a church building. So that gives you a little insight about how serious you can take his observations about anything to do with us.”  Despite the tension, Lentz added that he’s still a Post Malone fan. “He is a very gifted artist,” he said, “and I wish him nothing but the best.”  In Rolling Stone‘s original, wide-ranging story, a source close to Bieber also denied that he’s donated $10 million.

"""Alex Rodriguez slams report he’s threatening to cut child support payments Alex Rodriguez flatly denied a report that claimed he was threatening to cut child-support payments for his two daughters over a legal dispute with his ex-wife’s brother.  “I have always paid far more than the maximum in child support and that will never change,” the former New York Yankees star said in a statement to Page Six.  “It’s highly offensive to me that my former brother-in-law, who has been trying to pursue a frivolous case against me for four years and has gotten absolutely nowhere with it in court, is misrepresenting my relationship with my daughters to manipulate the public’s opinion,” he added.  The report Wednesday in the New York Daily News came soon after it was learned that A-Rod had just purchased a $15 million Manhattan apartment with girlfriend Jennifer Lopez.  According to the Daily News report, Rodriguez told his ex-wife Cynthia that he would cut his support payments for daughters Natasha, 13, and Ella, 9, over a legal dispute with her brother, Constantine Scurtis.  A-Rod’s alleged threat was meant to send a message to Scurtis, the Daily News added.  Cynthia had texted her brother, explaining: “I’m just trying to defend my child support situation … and it’s terrible.”  She continued, “I have an email from (Rodriguez) telling me that he’s basically making me pay for not stopping you and telling you that I hate you.”  The tension Cynthia is referring to is a four-year legal battle between Rodriguez and her brother.  Scurtis sued his ex brother-in-law in 2014, claiming he was pushed out of the real estate company they founded together when his sister’s marriage began to fail, the Daily News said. The lawsuit accuses Rodriguez of mortgage and insurance fraud, among other things.  “He’s totally out of control,” Cynthia said in another text, “but I share 2 kids with him so I try to keep e (sic) everything good for them.”  “I hope it all ends soon. It’s revolting,” Cynthia added.  Rodriguez and Cynthia divorced in 2008 after six years of marriage. The Daily News pointed out that Rodriguez definitely isn’t hurting for cash. He was paid $21 million by the Yankees in 2016 — the final year of his 10-year, $275 million contract — without having to play. He currently has a gig as part of ESPN’s “Sunday Night Baseball” team.  It’s unclear how much money Rodriguez is required to pay each month for child support, the Daily News said.  He and Lopez started dating in February 2017, and the two have been high-profile about their coupledom. They sometimes post photos of their newly blended family which consists of his kids and hers; she has 10-year-old twins Max and Emme with her ex-husband Marc Anthony.  Rodriguez expressed disgust at the way his former brother-in-law was using his daughters in an effort to turn the media against him for his own gain. Related Articles Ah, Bennifer!

"""Dame Judi Dench battles failing eyesight but says 'stop telling me to retire' Dame Judi Dench is battling failing eyesight which has left her unable to read scripts. But the actress has said she is driven “spare” by people asking when she will retire because she has no intention of leaving the stage.  The 79-year-old was diagnosed with macular degeneration, which can lead to blindness, several years ago.  She stars opposite Dustin Hoffman, 77, in a BBC1 Christmas adaptation of Roald Dahl’s Esio Trot, the touching story of a faltering love affair between two lonely pensioners.  We’ll tell you what’s true. You can form your own view. From 15p €0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.  Speaking at a screening of the film in central London, Dame Judi issued a plea for the capacities of older people not to be ignored. The Oscar-winner said: “It drives me absolutely spare when people say 'Are you going to retire?' or ‘Don’t you think it's time you put your feet up?’ or tell me my age.  “I loathe it. I don’t want to be told that I'm too old to do something; I want to try it first and then, if I don't succeed, then I can be told I can't do it.  “Otherwise, because you get to a certain age, it's ‘Oh well, you mustn't do that because you might have a fall or you can’t learn the lines or you can’t see’. Let me have a go. Let us all have a go.”  Dame Judi’s macular degeneration, an age-related condition that leads to a gradual loss of vision, which her mother also had, has left her struggling to watch films.  She is currently shooting The Hollow Crown, a BBC adaptation of Shakespeare’s history plays and will next be seen in a sequel to The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel and a much-delayed adaptation of Deborah Moggach’s novel Tulip Fever.  In Esio Trot, Dame Judi plays a flamboyant widow who is the object of tongue-tied bachelor Mr Hoppy’s (Hoffman) affections, but who only has eyes for her pet tortoise Alfie.  The story was adapted for the screen by Richard Curtis, whose hits include Four Weddings And A Funeral and Notting Hill.  Mr Curtis, famed for his romantic comedies starring Hugh Grant, said he thought the pair of elderly lovers in the story were the “couple most likely to stay together” out of all the characters in his films.  Curtis wrote the screenplay with Paul Mayhew-Archer, with whom he co-created the hit comedy The Vicar of Dibley. Mr Mayhew-Archer disclosed at the screening that he began working on the screenplay, shortly after being diagnosed with Parkinson’s Disease. He said the message behind Dahl’s story was particularly poignant: “Whatever happens to you, never give up. It’s never too late.”  Esio Trot, which also stars James Corden and features 60 real tortoises, is set to be the highlight of the BBC Christmas schedules.  Producers are picking over the Dahl catalogue for more hits after the success of the musical Matilda. The 90-minute Esio Trot is set to become an international money-spinner after The Weinstein Company picked up the US distribution rights.  Harvey Weinstein said: “Roald Dahl is one of the most revered children’s authors in history, so needless to say we're delighted to be on board with this project.”""",/home/yanwang_nuist/dev_workspace/prj_python/fnd-bootstrap/dataset/gossip/Images/gossip_test/HWxCktDBuq5hSOzfCPVfe1xBPDA6j4dZ.jpg,1.0
"""Robert Kardashian This article is about the attorney. For his son, the television personality, see Rob Kardashian  Robert George Kardashian (February 22, 1944 – September 30, 2003) was an American attorney and businessman. He gained national recognition as O. J. Simpson's friend and defense attorney during Simpson's 1995 murder trial. He had four children with his first wife, Kris Kardashian (née Houghton, later Jenner): Kourtney, Kim, Khloé, and Rob, who appear on their family reality television series, Keeping Up with the Kardashians, and its spinoffs.  Personal life  Kardashian was born in Los Angeles, California. He has a sister and brother, Barbara and Tom Kardashian.[2][3] His great-grandparents, Saghatel (""""Sam"""") and Harom Kardaschoff, were ethnic Armenian Spiritual Christian Prygun[4] immigrants from Karakale (now: Merkezkarakale), Kars Oblast of the Russian Empire (now Kars Province in Turkey). The family, known at the time by the surname Kardaschoff, in Russian style, made their way from their home village of Karakale probably to Bremerhaven, Germany, a popular emigration port. From there, they travelled to a new life in America. Their son Tatos anglicized his name to Tom, started a business in garbage collection in Los Angeles, and married another Kars-Karakale immigrant, Hamas Shakarian.[5]  Growing up in the Baldwin Hills area of Los Angeles, Kardashian attended Susan Miller Dorsey High School and the University of Southern California, from which he graduated in 1966 with a B.S. degree in business administration.[6] He earned a J.D. degree from the University of San Diego School of Law and practiced for about a decade; after that, he went into business. In 1973, Kardashian was one of the co-founders of the trade publication Radio & Records, which he and his partners sold for a large profit in 1979.[6] Kardashian also pioneered the idea of playing music between movies in theaters. He subsequently parlayed the concept into a business, starting a company called Movie Tunes.[7][8][9][10] He served as President and CEO of the firm and later invested in Juice Inc., a frozen yogurt company, and in a music video business called Concert Cinema.[11][12]  Marriages and children  Robert Kardashian dated Priscilla Presley from 1975 to 1976.[citation needed]  He had four children with his first wife, Kris Kardashian (née Houghton, subsequently Jenner): Kourtney, Kimberly, Khloé, and Rob.[13] The couple separated and divorced in 1991.[citation needed]  Shortly after separating from his first wife in 1991, Kardashian became engaged to Denice Shakarian Halicki, widow of movie producer H.B. Halicki.[14][15] The couple never married. In 1998, Kardashian married Jan Ashley; however, the marriage ended in annulment 30 days later. Ashley later claimed frequent upset and turmoil related to Kardashian's ex-wife Kris and their children """"were instrumental"""" in the demise of the relationship.[16][17][18] After dating for three years and proposing in 2001, Kardashian married his third wife, Ellen Pierson (née Markowitz), six weeks prior to his death.[19][20]  O. J. Simpson case  Kardashian and Simpson first met in the early 1970s and became close friends.[20]  Following the June 12, 1994, murder of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman, Simpson stayed in Kardashian's house to avoid the media. Kardashian was the man seen carrying Simpson's garment bag the day that Simpson flew back from Chicago. Prosecutors speculated that the bag may have contained Simpson's bloody clothes or the murder weapon.[21] When Simpson failed to turn himself in at 11 a.m. on June 17, 1994, Kardashian read a letter by Simpson to the assembled media. This letter was interpreted by many as a suicide note.[22]  Simpson was charged with the murders and subsequently acquitted of all criminal charges in a controversial criminal trial. Kardashian had let his license to practice law become inactive before the Simpson case but reactivated it to aid in Simpson's defense as a volunteer assistant on his legal team, alongside Simpson's main defense attorneys, Robert Shapiro and Johnnie Cochran. As one of Simpson's lawyers and a member of the defense """"Dream Team"""", Kardashian could not be compelled or subpoenaed to testify against Simpson in the case, which included Simpson's past history and behavior with his ex-wife Nicole, and as to the contents of Simpson's garment bag.[23] He sat by Simpson throughout the trial.[20]  Kardashian visited Simpson in jail regularly. According to an interview with the Los Angeles Times, Kardashian said, """"I've never been in a jail before. It's extremely depressing. It makes me sick every time I go down there. We can't have any physical contact. I want to hug him, I want to show him that I care. It's very difficult.""""[citation needed]  The New York Times reported that Kardashian said in a 1996 ABC interview that he had questioned Simpson's innocence: """"I have doubts. The blood evidence is the biggest thorn in my side; that causes me the greatest problems. So I struggle with the blood evidence.""""[23]  Illness and death  Kardashian was diagnosed with esophageal cancer in July 2003. He died two months later, on September 30, 2003, at age 59,[24] and was buried at Inglewood Park Cemetery in Inglewood, California.[25]  In popular culture  Kardashian was portrayed by David Schwimmer in the 2016 FX miniseries American Crime Story: The People v. O. J. Simpson. Schwimmer was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Limited Series or Movie for his performance, but lost to Sterling K. Brown, who portrayed Christopher Darden in the same series. In 2016 ESPN Films and their 30 for 30 series produced a five-part miniseries called O.J.: Made in America produced by Ezra Edelman.  In 2017, Kardashian was the subject of the pilot episode of the TV comedy series Over My Dead Body on Amazon Prime.[26]  See also""",/home/yanwang_nuist/dev_workspace/prj_python/fnd-bootstrap/dataset/gossip/Images/gossip_test/4OvEMBxGTDf4xLqwNr5eDaJliKRY4t6b.jpg,1.0

"""Katie Couric Opens Up About Matt Lauer's Firing from the Today Show More than a month has passed since Matt Lauer was fired from the Today show, and his former longtime colleague, Katie Couric, is now opening up about the former NBC anchor’s shocking dismissal.  “The whole thing has been very painful for me,” Couric, 61, tells PEOPLE. “The accounts I’ve read and heard have been disturbing, distressing and disorienting and it’s completely unacceptable that any woman at the Today show experienced this kind of treatment.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  “I had no idea this was going on during my tenure or after I left,” she continued. “I think I speak for many of my former colleagues when I say this was not the Matt we knew. Matt was a kind and generous colleague who treated me with respect. In fact, a joke I once made on late-night television was just that, because it was completely contrary to our brother-sister relationship. It’s still very upsetting. I really admire the way Savannah [Guthrie] and Hoda [Kotb] and the entire Today show staff have handled a very difficult situation.”  The late-night show joke that Couric refers to is when she said on Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen in 2012 that Lauer “pinches me on the ass a lot.” A clip of the comment made the rounds online in the wake of Lauer’s firing.  Couric spent 15 years co-hosting NBC’s Today show with Lauer, 60, but left in May 2006 to anchor the CBS Evening News.  NBC/Getty  Lauer was fired at the end of November by NBC News after the network received a “detailed complaint from a colleague about inappropriate sexual behavior,” with reason to believe “this may not have been an isolated incident.” Women have also anonymously accused him of sexual harassment and assault in reports published by Variety and The New York Times.  Following his firing, which was announced live on Today by Savannah Guthrie and Hoda Kotb, Lauer addressed the original allegations in a statement.  “There are no words to express my sorrow and regret for the pain I have caused others by words and actions,” he said, in part. “To the people I have hurt, I am truly sorry. As I am writing this, I realize the depth of the damage and disappointment I have left behind at home and at NBC.”  Although her PEOPLE interview is the first time Couric has spoken in detail about Lauer’s exit, she briefly broke her silence about the scandal on social media in December.  In a short response to an Instagram user, who called Couric out for not publicly addressing the scandal, the veteran journalist said, “It’s incredibly upsetting and I will say something when I’m ready to. Thanks for your interest.”  RELATED VIDEO: Women of Hollywood Attend Golden Globes Together in Support of the Time’s Up Movement  The claims against Lauer came as hundreds of women and men — including Rose McGowan, Ashley Judd, Terry Crews and Anthony Rapp — have publicly came forward about alleged sexual misconduct at the hands of powerful men in Hollywood, including Harvey Weinstein and Kevin Spacey.  The movement inspired the new Time’s Up initiative and legal defense fund that was created to help victims of sexual misconduct pursue legal action against their perpetrators. Time’s Up was a major focus at this year’s Golden Globes, where almost all the famous attendees wore black to raise awareness about the cause.  “I think it was really moving to see so many women support each other and demand change, not only for themselves, but for mistreated and marginalized women in all kinds of industries,” Couric tells PEOPLE about Time’s Up. “Clearly we are witnessing a sea change and a long overdue course correction.”  She also said that one of the new of the episodes of her upcoming six-part documentary Nat Geo series will focus on harassment women have experienced in their workplaces.  “One of my Nat Geo episodes explores the various obstacles that are holding women back in Hollywood, Silicon Valley and beyond,” she says. “I just interviewed Elisabeth Moss about this. Harassment is just one part of the equation.”  RELATED VIDEO: Hoda Kotb and Savannah Guthrie Are Today’s New Anchor Team  As for future projects, Couric is focused on her new documentary series as well as her popular podcast — and teaching her husband John Molner about social media.  “I’m having so much fun doing my podcast with my friend Brian Goldsmith,” she says. “I’ve been able to have extended and substantive conversations with so many great, interesting people, like Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Alec Baldwin, David Axelrod, Ava DuVernay and Ina Garten. And now we’re ‘dropping’ episodes weekly. Coming up: Laverne Cox and Amy Schumer.  “Meanwhile, I’m still happily married (after three years!) and I’m teaching John how to do Instagram stories,” she continues. “His are pretty lame so far. I’m also getting ready for my younger daughter Carrie’s college graduation. (GULP!) And there are some other cool projects I’ll be able to announce soon.

"""Scott Disick Freaks Out at Kourtney Kardashian Over Younes Bendjima! These days, Scott Disick is enjoying his """"nympho"""" girlfriend Sofia Richie and seems almost stable. But that wasn't always the case.  Like most reality television, Keeping Up With The Kardashians airs months after its filmed. So we're just now seeing Scott's 2017 meltdown drama.  Which means that, as you'll see in the video below, viewers are now treated to Scott freaking out over Kourtney's young, hot boyfriend.  It's no secret that Scott Disick doesn't like Kourtney Kardashian dating Younges Bendjima. He has made that very, very clear on various Keeping Up With The Kardashians clips.  But now we're gaining more insight into exactly how Scott uses his own bad behavior to act out for attention.  For Kourtney's attention.  Khloe summarizes the pattern at play pretty darn well:  """"So you told him you have a boyfriend, now he's doing this ‘cause he knows that every time he does that you come over there running.""""  That's a very unhealthy pattern of behavior.  Kourtney says that it's really draining her: """"I just honestly don't have the energy.""""  She continues her story, speaking to Khloe and to Kim.  """"So yeah I went to Scott's house because he called me and was really out of it.""""  So ... is that code for """"drunk,"""" or are we just guessing that because of how he spent so much of 2017?  Alarmingly, it sounds like Scott's freakout was enough to drive Kourtney away.  """"He was just very aggressive. And then I was like, ‘I'm leaving!'""""  Weird that Scott had no problem banging his way through a bunch of hot models born in 1998, but the moment that he finds out that Kourtney's enjoying a model of a 1993 vintage, he starts to freak out.  Kourtney didn't appreciate that one bit.  """"And then I just started crying and I was like, ‘I do not need to even be here.'""""  She's right. You do not need to babysit your ex just because his man feelings are hurt.  It sounds like Scott worried her enough that she had to instruct him.  """"And then I was like, ‘Just sit down!' Literally, you have talk to him like crazy, otherwise he won't listen.""""  Like ... like a dog?  """"So I'm like, ‘Sit down across the room from me.""""  She had some serious questions for him.  """"What the f--k is wrong with you? When is it going to be enough?""""  Kourtney summarizes exactly why she doesn't need to be holding the hand of a man-child.

"""Sofia Coppola triumphs with The Beguiled, a suspenseful Civil War revenge comedy The Beguiled masquerades as a Southern Gothic tale, with all the requisite grotesquerie. But beneath its frilly, corseted bodice, it’s a stone-cold revenge fantasy, laced with a potent cocktail of toxic comedy and pungent desire.  The film’s fixation on revenge means it feels considerably tighter and simpler than its marketing might have led you to believe. This isn’t the wild, extravagant romp of director Sofia Coppola’s Marie Antoinette, nor does it lean so plainly on the hormonal teenage angst of The Virgin Suicides. Simple, irresistible desire is what drives revenge movies — desire for retribution, inexorably enacted. And The Beguiled is set at Miss Martha Farnsworth’s Seminary for Young Ladies, a hotbed of sublimated desire and good breeding. (Following the film’s premiere at the 2017 Cannes Film Festival, Coppola became the second woman in Cannes history to win the Best Director award.)  Rating vox-mark vox-mark vox-mark vox-mark vox-mark  In her adaptation of Thomas Cullinan’s Civil War-set 1961 novel — on which a 1971 Don Siegel film, starring Clint Eastwood, was also based — Coppola turns Miss Martha’s Seminary into a secluded, mist-heavy wood between the worlds, populated by women rendered helpless by the Civil War and scarce resources to do anything but pray and wait it out.  In The Beguiled, women are frustrated at being left to flap in the wind like a lacy frock on a clothesline, while the boys go out to fight the real war. But society requires them to remain civilized, embroidering in the drawing room to the sound of booming cannon fire on the battlefield beyond the seminary’s gates. They’re reduced to praying for the soldiers, hiding their cow so nobody steals it, and trying to keep away from the gaze of the men who march by, lest they be tempted.  Years of that kind of thing can make you crazy, or it can be a clarifying force. In The Beguiled, much of the fun (and suspense) comes from trying to guess which is the case.  The Beguiled takes place late in the Civil War, when ennui has set in  The sister to The Beguiled in Coppola’s oeuvre is certainly The Virgin Suicides, another film about a house full of young women held captive for their own good (and in which Kirsten Dunst also starred). In that film, the girls are hungry for male interaction, partly because they want to have sex and partly because they’re just desperate for an outlet and an escape from their intense loneliness.  Those elements are in The Beguiled, for sure. But they’re best taken with the historical context in mind, and what the characters are experiencing from their secluded vantage point: the dismay of knowing their social order is disappearing, and the dreariness of living from day to day with nothing to do but keep at the embroidery, practice conjugating French verbs, maybe practice the violin.  The story picks up three years after the secession, when pigtailed Amy (Oona Laurence), gathering mushrooms in the Virginia woods, stumbles upon a wounded Union soldier, Corporal John McBurney (Colin Farrell). She brings him back to the sprawling house that’s home to the seminary and its headmistress, Miss Martha (Nicole Kidman, in one of her four roles at Cannes this year).  Most of the seminary’s students have gone home because of the war, but Edwina Morrow (a subdued Dunst) has stayed on as a teacher, and a cadre of other girls remains, stranded by the dangerous situation in their own hometowns across the war-torn South. The oldest of these girls is Alicia (Elle Fanning), a 19th-century version of Virgin Suicides’ Lux Lisbon (played by Dunst in that film), all flirtation and seduction.  The residents of the seminary first consider turning Cpl. McBurney over to soldiers — either his own or theirs — but appealing to “Christian charity,” they elect instead to bring him inside and tend to his wounded leg. Miss Martha puts him under with chloroform, then cleans the wound and stitches it up. And then, while he’s still out, she strips him down to his knickers and washes him off, pausing to take more than a few deep breaths.  All the women and girls are worried about him in the house, but when he wakes up, relations slowly improve between the affable McBurney and the women, particularly the oldest three: strong-willed, mature Miss Martha, quiet and dutiful Edwina, and precociously tantalizing Alicia, who all but winks at him the moment he sets eyes on her.  But it gradually becomes clear that McBurney (an Irishman fresh off the boat from Dublin who took a man’s place in the army for $300) fancies himself a charmer, and that he’s found himself in a rather ideal situation: surrounded by beautiful women and charming girls of all ages and personalities. And he’d rather not go back to the army anyway.  Naturally, he plays the field. Let’s just say it doesn’t end well.  In The Beguiled, Coppola plays with the look of the film to add to the story  Coppola again wields her talent for stylizing films to set up our expectations for The Beguiled. The Spanish moss and mist hangs heavily over the trees, as in a twisted fairy tale, the colors are a little washed out, and the edges of the frame are darkened slightly, all signifying a decaying Confederacy and its carefully tended social niceties, which Miss Martha is still trying so desperately to preserve.  But this is a comedy — a dark one, but a comedy nonetheless, in which a candlelit dinner table becomes a minefield of dramatic irony. So lest we take things too seriously, Coppola employs a pink cursive script for the title card, embellished with flourishes and compressed slightly from both ends. It calls to mind a trashy and inconsequential romance novel, which, when punctuated with the film’s moments of violence, wounds, and blood, feels more hilarious than horrifying.  In fact, it’s the mashed up stylistic markers of The Beguiled that make it so effective, especially as they skitter across the revenge plot humming along beneath the surface. As a film, The Beguiled is thrilling, delicious, wicked fun. But there’s also something purely pleasurable — and no less cathartic in the 21st century than it might have been in the 19th — to see a cowardly man with far too much self-regard and far too few scruples get what he deserves.  The Beguiled premiered at the Cannes Film Festival on May 24 (this review was originally published during the festival) and opens in US theaters on June 23.""",/home/yanwang_nuist/dev_workspace/prj_python/fnd-bootstrap/dataset/gossip/Images/gossip_test/hQYOEXAhReTG0Cj6odSDTbS8HkWVufXs.jpg,1.0

Chloe Lattanzi was particularly upset.  Olivia Newton-John’s daughter reposted a pic of Kourtney in a white coat with a drink in hand.

"""Charlize Theron on Playing a Female James Bond: I'm Very Old Charlize Theron has officially weighed in on the possibility of playing a female version of James Bond. Daniel Craig is still playing 007 for now, but James Bond 25, which is set to arrive in theaters next November, is said to be his last. That means, the franchise is heading for a reboot in the next couple of years and there's been talk, mostly from fans, about having a female Bond. Theron's name has been thrown around and now she's addressed the possibility.  During a recent interview, Charlize Theron was asked about playing James Bond. Nobody involved with the franchise, as far as we know, is actually looking at a female to play 007 in the future. Nor is there any indication Theron has been specifically approached, but her name has been bandied about, largely thanks to her roles in movies like Mad Max: Fury Road and Atomic Blonde. Theron says she likes the idea of going against type, but she feels she's too old for the part. Here's what she had to say about it.  """"You know, I don't have a feeling about it one way or the other. I love the idea that people are thinking outside the box. And I know for a long time people were talking about Idris Elba for it. And it's just nice to see people now thinking outside of [these] confined ideas of what we think a character can be. I'm really all for that. I think it's great that we are developing more characters within that genre for females, that they can take ownership. So it's a really nice thing for people to say. I'm very old, though. I would be a very old James Bond.""""  Charlize Theron has made quite the name for herself as a female action star in recent years, so it's understandable that if a gender-swapped version of James Bond is on the horizon, her name would be at the top of people's lists. Some fan art depicting her as the iconic MI6 spy even made the rounds online last year. Gillian Anderson from The X-Files is also a favorite for the part and she's even shown support for the idea.  As Charlize Theron points out, Idris Elba has been a name thrown out over the years, which also would represent a change for the character, as James Bond has always been portrayed as a white man. In regards to her being too old? That's not necessarily true. Daniel Craig is going to be 50 by the time James Bond 25 gets going and Roger Moore played the part until he was 57. That said, Theron, who is now 42, would be in her mid-40s by the time the opportunity came up, which may be a bit old for someone to start their tenure as the new 007.  Related: Official James Bond 25 Title and Cast Announcement Coming Tomorrow  The producers of the James Bond franchise are going to have a tough time following up Daniel Craig and one way to gain some attention would be to try something different. Though, gender-swapping one of the most iconic characters in cinema history may turn more fans off than it would bring to the franchise. At the very least, some changes could be coming. Producer Barbara Broccoli said last year that she's open to have a female direct a future Bond movie, which could help bring some new perspective to the character and the franchise. In any event, it doesn't sound like Charlize Theron plans on putting on a tux and taking out bad guys with a Walther PPK in the future.

His father, who owned a convenience store, put an ad for a guitar teacher in his shop window.[5] Urban took lessons from his teacher, Sue McCarthy,[6] and began entering local competitions, in addition to acting in a local theater company.[4] Urban has stated that his guitar playing was influenced by two rock players, Mark Knopfler (Dire Straits) and Lindsey Buckingham (Fleetwood Mac).  In 1983, Urban was a contestant on the Australian TV talent show New Faces.[7] A few years later, he began making the inroads into the Australian country music scene, with regular appearances on the Reg Lindsay Country Homestead TV Program, Mike McClellan's Music Program, and various other TV programs performing duets with local Brisbane girl Jenny Wilson. They won a Golden Guitar award at the Tamworth Country Music Festival. Urban also performed regularly on stage at the Northern Suburbs Country Music Club in Bald Hills, where he was a member. He was in a band called 'Kids Country', that performed during school holidays at various venues and made appearances on the Reg Lindsey show and Conway Country. He also teamed up with Angie Marquis, Tony Black, Peter Black and Tina Rouaen in a teen rock band that performed during the summer holidays at the local water slide and theme park.  Musical career [ edit ]  1990–1999: Early years [ edit ]  In 1990, Urban signed with EMI in Australia and released his self-titled debut album.[4] He appeared on the 1990 compilation album Breaking Ground - New Directions in Country Music, which was nominated for the 1991 ARIA Award for Best Country Album.[8] He toured as a backup act to Slim Dusty between 1993 and 1994. In the mid-1990s, both people recorded a re-worked duet of Dusty's classic """"Lights on the Hill"""". Urban appeared for the first time at the Grand Ole Opry backing Dusty.[9] He also sang backing vocals on INXS's live album Live Baby Live (1992).  Urban moved to Nashville, Tennessee, in 1992. The next year, he appeared in the music video for Alan Jackson's rendition of """"Mercury Blues"""".[10] He and Vernon Rust co-wrote """"Jesus Gets Jealous of Santa Claus"""" on Toby Keith's 1995 album Christmas to Christmas,[11] 4 Runner's 1996 single """"That Was Him (This Is Now)"""",[12] and """"Tangled Up in Love"""" on the Raybon Brothers' 1997 self-titled album.[13] In 1997, he formed a band known as The Ranch, which included drummer Peter Clarke and bassist Jerry Flowers. The Ranch released one self-titled album for Capitol Records Nashville and charted two singles on the Hot Country Songs charts that year: """"Walkin' the Country"""" and """"Just Some Love"""".[14] Throughout the late 1990s, Urban also played guitar on several other artists' albums, such as Paul Jefferson,[15] Tim Wilson, and Charlie Daniels.  1999–2001: Keith Urban [ edit ]  Urban released his self-titled American debut album in 1999 under the production of session pianist Matt Rollings. It was led by the number 18 single """"It's a Love Thing"""", followed by the number-four """"Your Everything"""", which made him the first male New Zealand performer to reach the Top 10 on the US country charts.[16] Its follow-up, """"But for the Grace of God"""", written by Charlotte Caffey and Jane Wiedlin of The Go-Go's, became his first number 1 hit on the charts. The last single, """"Where the Blacktop Ends"""", written by Steve Wariner and Allen Shamblin, went to number three. He won the Top New Male Vocalist Award at the 2001 Academy of Country Music Awards and the 2001 Country Music Association's Horizon Award. Allmusic's Thom Jurek described the first and third singles favorably, and praised the instrumental track """"Rollercoaster"""", saying that Urban was """"flat picking his Stratocaster like it was another extremity he was born with."""" He thought that those songs """"balance the slick and sometimes too-soft production on the record"""".[17]  2002–2006: Golden Road & Be Here [ edit ]  Urban released his second American album Golden Road in 2002. Of the 13 songs included on this album, Urban produced seven himself and co-produced the other six with Dann Huff.[18] The album's lead-off single """"Somebody Like You"""" was released in July 2002 and spent six weeks at number-one. The second single was the number-three hit """"Raining on Sunday"""", which Radney Foster had previously released as a single from his 1998 album See What You Want to See.[19] The third and fourth singles from the album, """"Who Wouldn't Wanna Be Me"""" and """"You'll Think of Me"""", went to number-one, with the latter winning him the Grammy Award for Best Male Country Vocal Performance in 2005.[20]  On 22 September 2005, Urban's third studio album Golden Road was certified triple platinum, for sales of three million copies.[21]  In 2002, Urban posed nude for Playgirl. On the Tonight Show with Jay Leno, he stated on that he regrets posing nude despite not showing any full frontal nudity.[22]  Urban performed """"Lights on the Hill"""" for Tamworth's 2004 tribute concert following the death of Australia's Slim Dusty, an artist whom he had both written for and covered.[23][24]  In 2005, Urban performed in front of European audiences for the first time. In May, Urban supported Bryan Adams on his UK and Ireland tour, which included dates at Earls Court, London, SECC, Glasgow and The Point, Dublin. On 6 June a UK only album, Days Go By, was released. The album contained songs from both Be Here and Golden Road.  """"You Look Good in My Shirt"""" was originally intended to be the fifth single from this album.[25] Instead, Capitol chose to release """"Days Go By"""", the lead-off to his third American album Be Here. By late 2004, this song became Urban's fifth number-one hit on the country chart. Although it was not officially released, """"You Look Good in My Shirt"""" spent one-week at number 60 on the country charts in July 2004[26] and remained a fan favorite.[25] The next single from this album was the #2 """"You're My Better Half"""", followed by the five-week number 1 """"Making Memories of Us"""", which was written by Rodney Crowell and previously recorded by both Tracy Byrd[27] and Crowell's side project The Notorious Cherry Bombs.[28] The next singles from this album were """"Better Life"""" and """"Tonight I Wanna Cry"""". The former, which Urban wrote with Richard Marx, spent six weeks at number 1 and the latter spent three weeks at number 2. After this song, """"Live to Love Another Day"""" spent 14 weeks on the country chart, reaching a peak of number 48, although it was never officially released as a single.[26]  2006–2008: Love, Pain, & The Whole Crazy Thing and Greatest Hits: 18 Kids [ edit ]  On 21 August 2006, Urban's """"Once in a Lifetime"""" debuted at No. 17, setting what was then a new record for the highest-debuting country single in the 62-year history of the Hot Country Songs chart.[29] Despite the high debut, the song peaked at number 6.[20] Following it was """"Stupid Boy"""", which was co-written by Sarah Buxton, went to number 3, and won him his second Grammy Award for Best Male Country Vocal Performance in 2007.[20] The album's next two singles, """"I Told You So"""" and """"Everybody"""", respectively peaked at numbers 2 and 5.[20] Urban released his first greatest hits collection Greatest Hits: 18 Kids on 20 November 2007.

In early May 2008, Urban debuted a new song at the Grand Ole Opry titled """"A New Sunshine"""". That same month, Urban recorded a new version of """"You Look Good in My Shirt"""" and released it as a single in June of that year. """"Over the years it (""""You Look Good In My Shirt"""") has always played like a hit song,"""" Urban said. """"That, combined with numerous requests from both fans and radio about why it was never a single, inspired us to get back into the studio and re-record the song."""" The single was a precursor to the """"Love, Pain & the Whole Crazy World Tour"""" concert DVD release in fall of 2008. Later that year, Urban served as a duet artist for Brad Paisley's single """"Start a Band"""", on which both he and Paisley sang and played guitar. This song was included on Paisley's album Play and it went to No. 1 in January 2009.  2008–2010: Defying Gravity [ edit ]  Urban announced that the lead single for his fifth studio album would be entitled """"Sweet Thing"""".

Urban performed this song on American Idol, during the season 8 finale, as a duet with eventual winner Kris Allen. """"Only You Can Love Me This Way"""", the third single, went to number-one.

""""It just speaks to all of the females in my life, particularly. For a guy who grew up with no sisters in a house of boys, it’s incredible how now I’m surrounded by girls.

"""Justin Bieber Explains Why He's Not in a Relationship: 'I Got My Heart Broken' There’s a sad reason why there’s no one special in Justin Bieber‘s life at the moment.  The singer opened up about it during an interview on Monday with Australian radio hosts Kyle and Jackie O.  “I haven’t been in a relationship for a while now,” the 21-year-old said after the hosts asked him who he’d be bringing with him to Australia when he performs there later this month.  When Kyle questioned why a young pop star would want to be seriously involved with anyone anyway, Bieber clarified, “I’m a relationship type of guy. I love to be in love, love cuddling. I love all that stuff.”  Exclusive Details on Justin Bieber’s New Single ‘What Do You Mean’  He added, “I got my heart broken. I’m just trying to let that heal up.”  That prompted Jackie O. to ask about his ex-girlfriend Selena Gomez. The radio host asked about Gomez’s name being scrawled on a wall in his new “What Do You Mean?” video, and he dismissed it, saying, “I think that might be fake,” before going on to say “it wasn’t me that did that.”""",/home/yanwang_nuist/dev_workspace/prj_python/fnd-bootstrap/dataset/gossip/Images/gossip_test/dhBzRa2ANN41OfGNOd5DEJulBoC4gBbV.jpg,1.0
"""The Simple Reason Margot Robbie Doesn't Wear A Wedding Ring Every Day Kevin Mazur via Getty Images Margot Robbie and her husband, Tom Ackerley, at the Time 100 Gala on April 25.  Every time a celebrity takes their wedding ring off, someone somewhere will write that it’s the end of so-and-so’s relationship.  Margot Robbie recently came under fire after telling Vogue Australia earlier this month that she only wears her wedding ring on weekends. The actress dismissed silly speculation by saying the timing is all in the name of work.  “When I’m at work, you can’t wear a wedding ring in costume,” the 27-year-old actress told “Extra” on Monday. “If your character’s not married, it’s gonna look really weird if you have a wedding ring on. There is nothing more to it — I simply cannot wear it when I am in costume.”  Robbie secretly married her husband, Tom Ackerley, last December in Australia. The two later confirmed their nuptials with a sassy picture that was a hit on social media.  A post shared by @margotrobbie on Dec 19, 2016 at 7:56pm PST  “I’ve seen so many other people on Instagram announce their engagement that way now,” the actress told Vogue Australia. “It’s kind of funny, so bizarre.”  Robbie and Ackerley now have a year of marriage under their belt, but the actress insists that “nothing’s really changed.”""",/home/yanwang_nuist/dev_workspace/prj_python/fnd-bootstrap/dataset/gossip/Images/gossip_test/BFpKLu0J3M88FVTSDoUepAZ8YSk2kngN.jpg,1.0
"""Would you spend $30K to look like Ivanka Trump? CLOSE Women are showing up at their plastic surgeon’s office saying I want to look like her. The picture on their phone? It’s Ivanka Trump. Susana Victoria Perez (@susana_vp) has more. Buzz60  Ivanka Trump at the White House on Feb. 3, 2017. (Photo: BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI, AFP/Getty Images)  When a woman shows a celebrity picture to her plastic surgeon and says, """"I want to look like her!"""" the face glowing on her phone might be Jennifer Lopez, Kim Kardashian, Angelina Jolie or Scarlett Johansson. And now, say some surgeons, the new star is Ivanka Trump.  """"In my practice, Ivanka is sort of the new style icon for plastic surgery,"""" says Houston surgeon Franklin Rose, who says he's already performed extensive work on """"several"""" women who wanted to look more like President Trump's elder daughter.  And why not? """"I think she's exquisite,"""" Rose says.  So does one of his patients, Jenny Stewart, 37, who last summer underwent more than six hours of surgery by Rose to reshape her nose and augment her breasts. She got liposuction to harvest fat to lift her buttocks, and she got injectable fillers for her face. All of it cost about $30,000, a discount because Stewart agreed to do interviews with reporters.  (People magazine profiled another of Rose's Texas patients, Tiffany Taylor, who spent $60,000 to look like Ivanka.)  """"At first, the healing process was painful ... but after that I'm absolutely happy with the results,"""" Stewart says.  Stewart had seen Ivanka in the media before the election but hadn't really thought of her as a model for enhancing her own appearance, which already was attractive. But she took notice when Donald Trump started to run for president and Ivanka, 35 and previously best known in New York, suddenly was all over global news feeds.  CLOSE Plastic surgery is becoming more and more mainstream, but should be considered seriously. USA TODAY  """"I was very much interested in the election, and that’s when I started thinking she was pretty,"""" says Stewart, a mother of two and an IT headhunter consultant who lives in Houston and Los Angeles. She Googled images of Ivanka and picked three she thought exhibited the features she admired and wanted to enhance on herself: Ivanka's small nose, the way her breasts fit her frame, and her rounded cheeks.  """"I thought Ivanka was classically pretty and not overdone,"""" she says. """"I had always admired her appearance, but then I started seeing her more often in the media. She was right there and still is. I follow her on Instagram and Facebook and I see her in my news feed.""""  Jenny Stewart, after plastic surgery by Houston surgeon Franklin Rose to enhance her appearance so she looks more like Ivanka Trump. (Photo: Jenny Stewart)  Oh, and politics had nothing to do with it, she says: She voted for Hillary Clinton.  In the old days, Rose says, patients would come in with pictures from magazines — say, Playboy — and now they come in with pictures on their cellphones. In recent years, patients would say they want buttocks like Lopez's or Kardashian's, breasts like Johansson's or lips like Jolie's.  Now, Ivanka has reached movie star-level celebrity — more visible than her stepmother, ex-model-turned-first lady Melania Trump — thanks to her steady presence on the campaign trail, her carefully curated Instagram page, and as an unofficial adviser to dad at the White House.  """"In the last year and a half, I've seen several patients who came in with pictures of Ivanka,"""" Rose says. """"The Ivanka thing is very widespread, at least in Texas.""""  Rod Rohrich, a plastic surgeon in Dallas and professor of plastic surgery at the University of Texas Southwestern, agrees.  """"Yes, absolutely, I have had a lot of patients in the past six months or more who ask about Ivanka’s great and sculpted, clean facial features, including her high cheekbones and beautiful skin and elegant nose,"""" says Rohrich. He says she's """"in the top five"""" on the list of people that patients cite when they ask for fillers on their cheeks and for rhinoplasty.  """"There’s always been an interest in the appearance and the trends of public figures and (Ivanka) has been a good example, because she's a very pretty woman, she's articulate and she has classic features,"""" says Alan Matarasso, a leading plastic surgeon in Manhattan, a professor of surgery at Hofstra University Northwell School of Medicine, and a vice president and spokesman for the American Society of Plastic Surgeons.  """"I can't give you any numbers,"""" Matarasso adds. """"But the reason is, she’s been in the media a lot, she has classic good looks and is not overdone in any way.""""  (Matarasso and other plastic surgeons say it is crucial for would-be patients to consult board-certified surgeons to get appropriate advice, no matter who they want to look like.The ASPS website provides a free service helping to link patients with doctors in their area.)  Sherrell Aston, a professor of plastic surgery at New York University and another prominent Manhattan surgeon with many celebrities for patients, says he's not sure how widespread the Ivanka-wannabe trend might be, but he wouldn't be surprised to learn it's growing.  Ivana Trump and her daughter, Ivanka, in 1995 in New York. (Photo: M. FERGUSON, RON GALELLA LTD.)  """"I think that across the country, plastic surgeons with aesthetic practices will see people who will mention her by name as being someone they admire and would like to have features that are similar,"""" Aston says. """"I don’t think it’s necessarily limited to Houston. (Ivanka) is widespread (in the media) and so is aesthetic surgery, and I think it’s conceivable it could happen anywhere in the country.""""  But not everywhere. Surgeon Lyle Leipziger, chief of plastic surgery at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, N.Y., and at Long Island Jewish Medical Center in New Hyde Park, N.Y., says his patients don't come in with celebrity pictures — or any pictures.  """"In my practice, patients don’t usually come in asking to look like someone else. They want to be a more enhanced version of themselves,"""" he says. """"Over the years, there isn’t a patient who hasn’t said, 'I want to look natural.' … The statement (among plastic surgeons) is the best plastic surgery doesn’t leave you looking plastic.""""  Nor does he believe most plastic surgeons are seeing an uptick in Ivanka-copying patients.  """"I certainly understand that Ivanka Trump is a beautiful, stunning and poised individual, and I can understand how people can identify with her, as people have with many (other celebrities) over the years,"""" he says. """"But I don’t know if this is happening elsewhere.""""

As previously announced, all SAG Awards presenters would all be female; traditionally awards are presented by a paired male and female star.  “Our women are very famous and yet they face the issues that women across this country do, which is they don’t have equality in income. They don’t have creative equality. And they have the same kind of safety issues that other women have been facing,” SAG Awards executive producer Kathy Connell previously told EW. “We just thought we wanted to acknowledge as many wonderful women on our stage this year as we could, while we’re celebrating the best performances by women and men of the year.”  Oscar-winning actor and producer Morgan Freeman is this year’s recipient of the SAG Awards Life Achievement Award, for his accomplishments in film as well as his humanitarian work.  In addition to watching all the red carpet action right here, the show will be available on PeopleTV, the streaming network from PEOPLE and Entertainment Weekly. It will also be available to stream on Twitter, tntdrama.com/sagawards, sagawards.org, People.com, EW.com, InStyle.com, and Time.com. PEOPLE and Entertainment Weekly will be furthering the conversation on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Snapchat throughout the evening using the hashtag #SAGAwardsLive.""",/home/yanwang_nuist/dev_workspace/prj_python/fnd-bootstrap/dataset/gossip/Images/gossip_test/9NmpZVDzXBVEqtwBj4Qv93Qgloq0XJqV.jpg,1.0
"""Nick Cannon on quitting 'America’s Got Talent': 'One of the best decisions I ever made in my career' America’s Got Talent returns to TV this week, but a familiar face won’t be in the mix. Nick Cannon hosted the show for eight seasons, but he quit after Season 12 (and was later replaced by Tyra Banks) after NBC threatened to fire him for ridiculing the network in his Showtime comedy special Stand Up, Don’t Shoot. Speaking to Yahoo Entertainment a year after the scandal, Cannon says he has no regrets and calls the move “probably one of the best decisions” of his career.  “It was super-controversial for some time … but it was a freedom-of-speech process and me standing firm for my own beliefs and culturally who I am, and really for all the employees who have been thumb-pressed by their bosses,” Cannon says, discussing the importance of adhering to his brand. “I kind of stood up and said, ‘Yo, I was threatened for some content that I created.’ And they wanted me to shape up and get in line and watch my choice of words or how I speak about the network. … I was threatened to be fired. I told them, ‘You can’t fire a boss. I quit!’”  23 PHOTOS Mariah Carey and Nick Cannon together See Gallery Mariah Carey and Nick Cannon together INGLEWOOD, CA - MARCH 24: (L-R) Monroe Cannon, Mariah Carey, Nick Cannon, and Moroccan Scott Cannon arrives at the Nickelodeon's 2018 Kids' Choice Awards at The Forum on March 24, 2018 in Inglewood, California.

You’re the No. 1 host on television, highest-paid,’ all of that stuff. And I was like, ‘None of that stuff matters to me. I’m an artist, and it’s not about money. It’s about having my own self-worth.”  Since wrapping his final AGT season in 2016, Cannon certainly hasn’t slowed down. He’s been working on the 11th season of his comedy game show Wild ‘N Out, studying in his “spare time” at Howard University, and, most important, releasing new music.  “I’ve probably made so much more money since walking away from [AGT] and doing it the way that I wanted to do it. I’m almost like, ‘Man, I should’ve stepped away earlier,’” Cannon says. “You ever had those decisions where you’re kind of in your comfort zone and so you kind of go about the mundane process, and as soon as you step out of your comfort zone it’s all of this freedom and the universe starts to just throw so many things in your direction? That’s what happened. I’m elated with everything that I’ve been doing since I stepped away from America’s Got Talent.”  More from :  And the winner of ‘The Voice’ season 14 is ...

She added that she is looking forward to seeing Seacrest on the Oscars red carpet, and, “Speaking on behalf of all of us here, I know what an easy, professional, great person you are, and I feel very, very lucky to work with you each and every day.”  Seacrest has denied claims that he sexually harassed his former stylist Suzie Hardy while she was employed by the E! network.  Ripa’s endorsement came just a day after she appeared to take a dig at Seacrest on the show, with regards to the sexual-misconduct allegations plaguing him.  And insiders tell us that the duo’s relationship is not as sunny as it seemed on the show Thursday.  Said a source: “Kelly doesn’t want to risk anything happening to ‘Live’ . . . She is understandably livid because it could potentially f - - k up her show.”  Another added, “They oversell their friendship . . . Her reputation is rolled up in this — this is her show. For Kelly, there’s not a Plan B. She has to make a decision and rally around him.”  Reps did not comment, but another source insisted, “He’s one of her closest friends, and they’re very protective of each other. They’ve known each other for years and talk about everything . . . it’s been a tough week.”  E! is sticking with Seacrest as a red-carpet Oscars host, though sources told Page Six some stars may steer clear of him, while the network will line up only friendly interviews.""",/home/yanwang_nuist/dev_workspace/prj_python/fnd-bootstrap/dataset/gossip/Images/gossip_test/yKHF16O9pcHS3zdoCIPqt85dr37VbJtu.jpg,1.0
